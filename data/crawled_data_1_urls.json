You have the option to submit a report anonymously; however, the\n          Office of Community Standards and Conduct may be limited in completing the investigation and taking\n          disciplinary action without the ability to thoroughly investigate by contacting you as the reporting party.\nReport an Incident\nHazing Defined\nThe 70th Texas Legislature enacted a law concerning hazing. Under the law, individuals or organizations\n          engaging in hazing could be subject to fines and charged with a criminal offense.\nAccording to the law, a person can commit a hazing offense not only by engaging in a hazing activity, but\n          also by soliciting, directing, encouraging, aiding or attempting to aid another in hazing; by intentionally,\n          knowingly or recklessly allowing hazing to occur; or by failing to report, in writing to the Dean of Students\n          or another appropriate official of the institution, first-hand knowledge that a hazing incident is planned or\n          has occurred. The fact that a person consented to or acquiesced in a hazing activity is not a defense to\n          prosecution for hazing under this law.\nIn an effort to encourage reporting of hazing incidents, the law grants immunity from civil or criminal\n          liability to any person who reports a specific hazing event in good faith and without malice to the Dean of\n          Students or other appropriate official of the institution and immunizes that person for participation in any\n          judicial proceeding resulting from liability that might otherwise be incurred or imposed as a result of the\n          report. The penalty for failure to report is a fine of up to $1,000, up to 180 days in jail, or both.\n          Penalties for other hazing offenses vary according to the severity of the injury which results and include\n          fines from $500 to $10,000 and/or confinement for up to two years.\nThe law defines hazing as: any intentional, knowing or reckless act, occurring on or off the campus\n            of an educational institution, by one person alone or acting with others, directed against a student, that\n            endangers the mental or physical health or safety of a student for the purpose of pledging, being initiated\n            into, affiliating with, holding office in or maintaining membership in any organization whose members are\n            or include students at an educational institution.\nHazing includes but is not limited to:\n\nany type of physical brutality, such as whipping, beating, striking, branding, electric shocking, placing\n            of a harmful substance on the body or similar activity;\nany type of physical activity, such as sleep deprivation, exposure to the elements, confinement in a\n            small space, calisthenics, or other activity that subjects the student to an unreasonable risk of harm or\n            that adversely affects the mental or physical health or safety of the student;\nany activity involving consumption of food, liquid, alcoholic beverage, liquor, drug or other substance\n            which subjects the student to an unreasonable risk of harm or which adversely affects the mental or\n            physical health of the student;\nany activity that intimidates or threatens the student with ostracism, that subjects the student to\n            extreme mental stress, shame or humiliation, or that adversely affects the mental health or dignity of the\n            student or discourages the student from entering or remaining registered in an educational institution, or\n            that may reasonably be expected to cause a student to leave the organization or the institution rather than\n            submit to acts described in this subsection;\nany activity that induces, causes or requires the student to perform a duty or task which involves a\n            violation of the Penal Code.\n\nUniversity Disciplinary Rules\nThis law does not affect or in any way limit the right of the university to enforce its own rules against\n          hazing under UTDSP5003, Student Code of Conduct.\n\n\nDangerous or Degrading Activities\nActivities which under certain conditions constitute acts which are dangerous, harmful or degrading, in\n          violation of University rules include, but are not limited to:\n\nCalisthenics, such as sit-ups, push-ups or any other form of physical exercise;\nTotal or partial nudity at any time;\nThe eating or ingestion of any unwanted substance;\nThe wearing or carrying of any embarrassing, degrading or physically burdensome article; \nPaddle swats, including the trading of swats; \nPushing, shoving, tackling or any other physical contact;\nThrowing any substance on a person;\nConsumption of alcoholic beverages accompanied by either threats or peer pressure;\nLineups for the purpose of interrogating, demeaning or intimidating;\nTransportation and abandonment (road trips, kidnaps, walks, rides, drops);\nConfining individuals in an area that is uncomfortable or dangerous (hot box effect, high temperature,\n            too small);\nAny form of individual interrogation;\nAny type of servitude that is of personal benefit to the individual members;\nWearing of embarrassing or uncomfortable clothing;\nAssigning pranks such as stealing, painting objects, harassing other organizations;\nIntentionally messing up the house or a room for clean up;\nDemeaning names;\nYelling or screaming; and\nRequiring boxing matches or fights for entertainment.\n\nOrganizations Found Responsible for Accusations of Hazing\nIn accordance with requirements of the Texas Education Code, Section 51.936(c), the following\n          organizations have been disciplined for hazing and/or convicted for hazing, on or off campus, during the\n          preceding three years.\n\nView the Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 The University of Texas at Dallas\nStudent Affairs\nDean of Students\nCommunity Standards and Conduct\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n"

The forms, which are supplied by each state, must be distributed before the registration cut-off date for every federal and gubernatorial election, as well as special elections for federal office.\nIn 2008, the Higher Education Act was amended making it permissible to electronically distribute information related to voter registration.\nThe University of Texas at Dallas recognizes the need for responsible citizenship. Part of this responsibility includes the necessity to participate in federal, state and local elections. To comply with the Higher Education Act, students receive an email that provides them with information about how to register to vote.\nRegister to Vote\nAny student not registered to vote may obtain information at\u00a0votetexas.gov.\nAdditional organizations that provide voter registration information:\nThe League of Women VotersRock the VoteStudent PIRGs New Voters Project\n1998 Higher Education Act\nTitle IV \u2013 Student Assistance, Part G \u2013 General Provisions 489.

If an institution has not received a sufficient quantity of forms to fulfill this section from the state within 60 days prior to the deadline for registering to vote in the state, the institution shall not be held liable for not meeting the requirements of this section during that election year.\n(C) This paragraph shall apply to elections as defined in section 301(1) of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2 U.S.C. 431(1)), and includes the election for governor or other chief executive within such State).\n(2) REGULATION PROHIBITED \u2013 No officer of the executive branch is authorized to instruct the institution in the manner in which the amendment made by this subsection is carried out.\nThe Higher Education Amendments of 2008\u00a0added the following text to the Voter Registration Act:\n(D) The institution shall be considered in compliance with the requirements of subparagraph (A) for each student to whom the institution electronically transmits a message containing a voter registration form acceptable for use in the state in which the institution is located, or an Internet address where such a form can be downloaded, if such information is in an electronic message devoted exclusively to voter registration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTACT US\nStudent Government OfficeStudent Union 2nd Floor,\u00a0SU 2.401Monday-Friday, 8:30am - 5:00pm972-883-2284sg@utdallas.edu\n\n\n\nCONNECT WITH US\n Student Government on Facebook\n Student Government on Instagram\n Student Government on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

They take on projects, investigate and listen to students\u2019 concerns, and draft bills and resolutions to be presented to and voted on by the senate.\nAll senators are assigned to a committee, where they work with the chair and other members on the issues or projects at hand.

The committee is the go-to for major problems concerning all students who live in the residence halls/apartments and a way for residents to communicate with administration. In addition, the committee comes up with unique projects that tailor to UTD student needs or bring innovative ideas from other campuses onto ours. The overall goal is to ensure that those who live at UTD have more control over their living situation and feel that it is a home away from home.\nCurrent Projects:\nReview of the University Housing Agreement/creation of an educational pamphlet about renter\u2019s rightsCreate outlets for residents to express housing complaints and concernsHost events with ResLife to increase student engagement\nStudent Affairs Committee\nStudent Affairs Committee Chair: Margaret Moore (She/Her/Hers)\nThe Student Affairs Committee works with various departments on campus to better the lives of students, primarily addressing issues related to student life outside of housing or academics.

We aim to serve the student body by being advocates for minority rights and by prioritizing initiatives that amplify the voices of underrepresented students. This is accomplished by working alongside several departments on campus that are already dedicated to the same cause, and by serving as a resource to culturally-affiliated student organizations. Our goal is to ensure that the student experience is equitable and that all students feel welcome regardless of their backgrounds.\nCurrent Projects:\nInstituting a cultural mentorship program for incoming studentsMaking a consolidated guidebook with various campus resourcesCreating a \u201ctips jar\u201d to aid students in expressing their concernsWorking to get trans students the ability to change name/email with the university\nAd Hoc Committees\nStudent Government sometimes forms ad hoc committees to solve or investigate a specific and often urgent issue.

General Provisions\nSubsection 1: Purpose\n\nPursuant to the Regents Rules, the University of Texas at Dallas (UT Dallas) has developed its policy regarding student conduct and discipline in accordance with The University of Texas System (UT System) model policy. Each student is charged with notice and knowledge of and compliance with the contents and provisions thereof. Reporting to the Dean of Students, the Office of Community Standards and Conduct seeks to support the mission of The University of Texas at Dallas by promoting integrity, civility, and community on campus. Recognizing that students make mistakes, we strive to help them acknowledge their personal responsibilities as members of the University community through fairly and consistently upholding the Student Code of Conduct. By doing so, we help bring student actions into congruence with the expectations set forth by the University while challenging them to demonstrate ethical decision making and personal integrity.\nAs members of the UT Dallas community, all students are expected to uphold the Comet Creed: As a Comet, I pledge honesty, integrity, and service in all that I do. Additionally, students are required to obey federal, state, and local laws and to comply with UT System and University rules and regulations.\nThe conduct review process is an administrative process and meant to be educational in nature. This process is separate from and may be carried out prior to, simultaneously with, or following civil or criminal proceedings. Outcomes including finding of responsibility and sanctions shall not be subject to change because of criminal or civil outcomes.\n\nSubsection 2: Scope\n\nThis policy applies to student organizations as well as individual students. Student organizations are accountable for the conduct and actions of their members.\nAn individual who is not currently enrolled as a University student remains subject to the disciplinary process for conduct that occurred while a student. Each student shall be responsible for their conduct from the time of application for admission through the actual awarding of a degree even when the conduct occurs prior to the beginning of classes and in between semesters. This includes conduct that is discovered after the awarding of a degree.\nA student is accountable for conduct that occurs on or off campus. University officials will review off-campus conduct pursuant to this policy. Factors considered in determining when to initiate a formal investigation for off campus conduct include, but are not limited to, whether the conduct impairs, interferes with, or obstructs any institutional activity or the mission, processes, and functions of the institution and whether the conduct adversely affects University interests.\n\nSubsection 3: Definitions\n\nUnless the context requires a different meaning, the definitions following apply to this policy. \n    \nA \"day\" means Monday through Friday except for days on which the University is officially closed or when regularly scheduled classes are suspended due to emergency situations.\n\"Dean\" means Dean of Students and refers to the administrative officer or officers responsible for the administration of the disciplinary process. The Dean of Students may designate individual(s) to administer disciplinary cases under this policy.\n\"Vice President\" means the Vice President for Student Affairs or the Vice President for Student Affairs' designee.\nA \"student\" means a person enrolled or formerly enrolled at the University and is eligible to continue enrollment in the semester or summer session that follows; a person accepted for admission or readmission to the University; a person who engaged in prohibited conduct at a time when he or she met any of the prior.\n\"University\" or \"institution\" means The University of Texas at Dallas.\n\"UT System\" means The University of Texas System.\n\"University rule\" means a rule, a regulation, a policy, or instruction contained in the University's Handbook of Operating Procedures or other official University publication or document.\n\"Discipline Committee\" means individuals selected in accordance with procedures adopted by the University pursuant to the recommendation of the Vice President for Student Affairs to hear disciplinary charges, make findings of fact, and, upon a finding of responsibility, impose the appropriate sanction(s).\n\"Campus\" consists of all real property, buildings, or facilities owned or controlled by UT Dallas.\n\"Faculty\" means any tenured or non-tenured, full or part-time instructor whose responsibility includes teaching. \n\"Hearing advisor\" means the individual who is responsible for oversight of administrative duties during or prior to the hearing. \n\"Complainant\" is defined as The University of Texas at Dallas or the person making a referral to the Dean.\n\"Respondent\" is defined as the student or student group alleged to have violated the Student Code of Conduct. \n\"Sanction\" is a consequence imposed in response to a violation of University rules, policies or procedures.\n\"May\" is used in the permissive sense. \n\"Shall\", \"must\", \"should\", and \"will\" are used in the imperative sense.\n\"Hearing Panel\" or \"Hearing Officer\" refers to individuals selected from the pool of faculty, staff, and student members of the Discipline Committee to participate in individual hearings.\n\"Staff\" means non-faculty employees of the University. \n\"Student organization\" means enrolled students who make up a common interest group that may or may not be registered through the Student Organization Center, sponsored by a campus school or department, or who officially represent the University. \nA \"witness\" means someone who may have information related to an alleged violation of this policy. \nAn \"advisor\" is a person who provides support to the student(s) throughout the conduct process. An advisor may be an attorney. The advisor may only confer with and advise a student. The advisor may not verbally advocate to the Dean or Hearing Panel/Hearing Officer on behalf of a student.\n\n\n\nSubsection 4: Confidentiality of Disciplinary Process\n\nIn accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), a student's disciplinary files are considered \"educational records.\" These records are confidential and may only be accessed by the student, the Dean, or University officials with legitimate educational interests and as otherwise provided by law.\nIn cases involving student conduct, the Dean will notify the referring individual of the outcome of a disciplinary process as necessary for the referring individual to perform their duties and as permitted by law. In cases of academic dishonesty, the Dean will promptly notify the appropriate faculty member regarding the outcome of the disciplinary process so that the outcome may be properly recorded. In either case, the Dean will notify other appropriate University officials as necessary and as permitted by law.\n\nSection B. Administration of Discipline\nSubsection 5: Dean of Students\n\nThe Dean has primary authority and responsibility for the administration of student discipline.\nIt shall be the Dean's responsibility to investigate allegations that a student has violated a Regents' Rule, University rule, or any provision of federal, state, and/or local laws, with the exception of the Sexual Misconduct Policy [UTDBP3102] and some cases of discrimination [UTDBP3090].\nIn carrying out these responsibilities, the Dean works cooperatively with academic administrators and faculty members in the disposition of academic dishonesty and with staff members in Residential Life in the disposition of campus housing violations. The Dean may seek, as needed, additional information from individuals who have expertise relative to cases, especially in instances of academic dishonesty involving technical material, projects, or assignments.\n\nSubsection 6: Faculty Role in Academic Violations\n\nJudgments of academic dishonesty are distinguished from academic judgments concerning whether a student has or has not completed an assignment as required. The former involve considerations of misconduct and sanctioning and are the responsibility of the Dean.\nUnder authority delegated by the Dean, a faculty member who has reason to suspect that a student has engaged in academic dishonesty may conduct a conference with the student in compliance with the following procedures:\n    \nthe student may be informed that they are believed to have committed an act or acts of academic dishonesty in violation of the Student Code of Conduct;\nthe student may be presented with any information in the knowledge or possession of the instructor which tends to support the allegation(s) of academic dishonesty;\nthe student will be given an opportunity to present information on their behalf;\nafter meeting with the student, the faculty member may: \n    \nchoose not to refer the allegation(s) if it is determined that the allegation(s) are not supported by the evidence; or,\nrefer the allegation(s) to the Dean on the electronic referral form and attach all supporting documentation of the alleged violation. The faculty member is given the opportunity to suggest a recommended sanction or remedy to be applied on the electronic referral form; however, final sanction decisions are made by the Dean of Students or Hearing Panel Chair/Hearing Officer that are appropriate for the circumstances;\n\n\nthe faculty member must not impose any independent sanctions upon the student in lieu of a referral to the Dean.\nIt is important that referrals are submitted within a reasonable time period; generally within one week after the alleged incident.\n\n\nIf the faculty member chooses not to meet with the student, they must forward the appropriate documentation to the Dean. The faculty member is encouraged to inform the student of the allegation(s) and notify the student that the information has been forwarded to the Dean for investigation.\nUpon receipt of the referral form and supporting material/documentation from the faculty member, the Dean shall proceed under Section E. If the student is found in violation of the Student Code of Conduct, the Dean or Hearing Panel/Hearing Officer will review the student's prior disciplinary record and assess sanctions appropriate to the circumstances. The Dean will inform the student and the faculty member of the decision.\nIf a student withdraws from a course and is ultimately found responsible for academic dishonesty, a grade sanction (ie. \"F\" or lowered grade) in the course that is assessed by the Dean or Hearing Panel/Hearing Officer will replace any withdrawal notation on the transcript.\nPending disciplinary action, the student remains responsible for all academic exercises and syllabus requirements. The student may remain in class if the student's presence in the class does not interfere with the professor's ability to teach the class or the ability of other class members to learn. (See Subsection 7 for additional information regarding the removal of a student from class).\n\nSubsection 7: Faculty Role in Removal for Misconduct\n\nPrimary responsibility for managing the classroom environment rests with the faculty. Misconduct reported by faculty will usually involve disruptive behavior in class or in relation to a class. Under authority delegated by the Dean, a faculty member who has reason to believe that a student has engaged in disruptive behavior may do one of the following:\n    \nIf the disruptive behavior was directly witnessed by the faculty member or if the faculty member has clear documentary evidence, the case should be referred directly to the Dean with the reasons and/or evidence for the charge and a recommendation for resolution. The Dean shall proceed under Section E; or\nIf the disruptive behavior was not directly witnessed by the faculty member but was witnessed or reported by students or others, the faculty member may meet with the student(s) involved and discuss the alleged violation and the evidence that supports the allegation. Such meetings should be documented to the greatest extent possible. After such meeting or meetings, the faculty member may refer the allegation(s) with the assembled documentation to the Dean with a recommendation for resolution, or choose not to refer the allegations to the Dean if the faculty member concludes that they are not supported by the evidence.\nIf the faculty member considers the behavior of the student menacing or threatening, they may request the Dean remove the student from the class with immediate effect until the matter is formally resolved. This request will be considered, pending review of the information regarding the incident(s).\n\n\nStudents who engage in any acts that result in disruption of a class may be directed by the faculty member to leave the class for the remainder of the class period. This provision is not designed to be used as a means to admonish classroom dissent. The expression of a disagreement with the instructor is not in itself disruptive behavior.\nA student who repeatedly engages in disruptive classroom behavior shall be referred by the faculty member to the Dean who will proceed under the provisions of Section E.\nA student will not be removed permanently from the classroom without review by the Dean.\n\nSubsection 8: Staff Role in Removal for Misconduct\n\nA member of the University staff who has been subject to or has witnessed conduct that is prohibited by the Student Code of Conduct may do either of the following:\n    \nCall the campus police to determine next steps for the offending person. The police will report the matter to the Dean. The Dean shall proceed under Section E; or\nReport the matter to their supervisor and the Dean of Students by completing the misconduct referral form which can be found on the Dean's website. The report should include the staff person's written account of the incident and any additional documentation that might be available. The Dean shall proceed under Section E;\n\n\nIf the misconduct or disruptive behavior was not directly witnessed by the staff person but was witnessed or reported by students or others, the staff person should inform their supervisor and refer the matter and the witnesses to the Dean. The Dean shall proceed under Section E.\n\nSection C. Student Standards of Conduct\nSubsection 9: Code of Conduct\n\nThe University of Texas at Dallas has rules and regulations for the orderly and efficient conduct of their business, and each student is accountable for knowledge of and compliance with the Student Code of Conduct and other University policies.\nBecause the value of an academic degree depends on the absolute honesty, integrity, and character of the student, the University expects all students to maintain a high level of responsibility with respect to their behavior. As a member of the University community, it is imperative that a student maintain a high standard of individual responsibility and civility.\nThe Dean may initiate disciplinary proceedings under Section E against a student accused of a violation of the Code of Conduct upon complaint by a faculty member, staff member, student, or other source.\nAny behavior which may have been influenced by the use of drugs or alcoholic beverages shall not in any way limit the responsibility of the student for the consequences of their actions. \nInstructors are encouraged to set clear expectations regarding collaborations that are permitted to occur and materials that can be used on work done outside the classroom (homework, take home exams, etc. ). Students should assume any external assistance is prohibited unless clearly notified otherwise by the instructor.\nDisciplinary action may be initiated for misconduct which includes:\n    \nPlagiarism: The adoption or reproduction of ideas, words, statements, images or works of another as one's own or work offered for credit without appropriate attribution.

Hazing\nSubsection 10: Hazing Defined\nThe University of Texas at Dallas is committed to providing a safe educational environment for students and will not tolerate hazing by any group or individual associated with the University. Engaging in hazing, submitting to hazing, or failing to report first-hand knowledge of hazing incidents are prohibited by state law.\nHazing is defined by Texas State law (Texas Education Code, Chapter 37:\nSubchapter F: Hazing) as: \"any intentional, knowing, or reckless act, occurring on or off the campus of an educational institution, by one person alone or acting with others, directed against a student for the purpose of pledging, being initiated into, affiliating with, holding office in, or maintaining membership in an organization if the act:\n\nis any type of physical brutality, such as whipping, beating, striking, branding, electronic shocking, placing of a harmful substance on the body, or similar activity;\ninvolves sleep deprivation, exposure to the elements, confinement in a small space, calisthenics (exercise), or other similar activity that subjects the student to an unreasonable risk of harm or that adversely affects the mental or physical health or safety of the student;\ninvolves consumption of a food, liquid, alcoholic beverage, liquor, drug, or other substance, other than as described in number five below, that subjects the student to an unreasonable risk of harm or that adversely affects the mental or physical health or safety of the student;\nany activity that induces, causes, or requires the student to perform a duty or task that involves a violation of the Penal Code;\nor involves coercing, as defined by Section 1.07, of the Texas Penal Code, a student to consume:\n    \na drug;\nor an alcoholic beverage or liquor in an amount that would lead a reasonable person to believe that the student is intoxicated, as defined by Section 49.01, Texas Penal Code.\n\n\n\nThe above includes hazing that is with or without the consent of participants. The University charges each student with notice and knowledge of full Texas State laws regarding hazing which can be found in Texas Statute Title 2, Subtitle G, Chapter 37, Subchapter F.  Any person with knowledge that a specific hazing incident has occurred on or off campus must immediately report the incident to the Dean.\nSubsection 11: Immunity\n\nPer Texas Statute Title 2: \"Any person who voluntarily reports a specific hazing incident involving a student in an educational institution to the Dean of Students or other appropriate official of the institution is immune from civil or criminal liability that might otherwise be incurred or imposed as a result of the reported hazing incident if the person:\n    \nreports the incident before being contacted by the institution concerning the incident or otherwise being included in the institution's investigation of the incident; and\nas determined by the dean of students or other appropriate official of the institution designated by the institution, cooperates in good faith throughout any institutional process regarding the incident.\n\n\nImmunity extends to participation in any judicial proceeding resulting from the report.\nA person is not immune if the person:\n    \nreports the person's own act of hazing;\nreports an incident of hazing in bad faith or with malice\".\n\n\n\nSection E. Disciplinary Proceedings and Disposition\nIf there is a more specific policy that specifies the proceedings for investigation, such as the Sexual Misconduct policy [UTDBP3102], that policy will govern; however, all the powers provided herein to the Dean for investigations involving student witnesses, including summons, interim disciplinary action, and withholding transcripts, grades, and degrees may be delegated to the investigator designated to that policy.\nSubsection 12: Investigation\n\nAll allegations and information relating to a violation of this policy shall be given to the Dean.\nAction under this policy may go forward regardless of other possible or pending administrative, civil, or criminal proceedings arising out of the same or other events.\nThe Dean shall investigate the alleged violation. The investigation shall include an attempt to confer with the accused student concerning the allegations. Following completion of the investigation, the Dean may: \n    \ndismiss the allegation;\nproceed administratively under Subsection 13; or\nprepare a hearing notice based on the allegation and proceed under Subsection 14. \n\n\nPending a hearing or other disposition of allegations against a student, the Dean may take such immediate interim disciplinary action as is appropriate to the circumstances when such action is in the best interest of the institution. This includes but is not limited to a suspension and ban from the campus when it reasonably appears that the continuing presence of the student poses a potential danger to persons or property or where the student poses a potential threat for disrupting any activity authorized by the University. In the case of interim discipline involving a partial or full ban from campus or a prohibition from attending any course, a hearing will generally be held under the hearing procedures specified in Subsection 13-15 within ten (10) days after the interim disciplinary action was taken; however, if the Dean determines there is good cause, the 10-day period may be extended for a reasonable period. \nNotwithstanding the above, the Dean may withhold the issuance of an official transcript, grade, diploma, certificate, or degree to a student alleged to have violated a rule or regulation of the System or the University that would reasonably allow the imposition of such sanction. The Dean may take such action pending a hearing, resolution by administrative disposition, and/or exhaustion of appellate rights if the Dean has provided the student an opportunity to give a preliminary response to the allegations and, in the opinion of the Dean, the best interests of the UT System or the University would be served by this action.\nIn cases involving a violation of the Sexual Misconduct Policy [UTDBP3102], the investigation will be conducted by the Title IX Coordinator or their designee.\n\nSubsection 13: Administrative Disposition\n\nIn any case, except in a case finding a violation of the Sexual Misconduct Policy [UTDBP3102], where the accused student elects not to dispute the facts upon which the allegations are based, the student may execute a written waiver of the hearing procedures and accept the sanction(s) or reserve the right to appeal the sanction(s) as outlined in Section G.\nIn the event a student disputes the facts and/or allegations or at the discretion of the Dean, a hearing before a Hearing Panel or Hearing Officer may be arranged. \nIn any case finding a violation of the Sexual Misconduct Policy [UTDBP3102], the case will proceed under Subsection 14 of this Policy unless both the accused and the accuser agree to the terms of the administrative disposition and thus waive the hearing and appeals.\n\nSubsection 14: Hearing Panel/Hearing Officer\n\nThe University of Texas at Dallas has a Discipline Committee that consists of faculty, staff, and students. In those cases in which the respondent disputes the facts and/or allegations upon which the alleged conduct violations are based, or at the discretion of the Dean of Students, such allegations shall be heard and determined by a fair and impartial Hearing Officer or a Hearing Panel, consisting of an appropriate number of faculty, staff, and students drawn from the Discipline Committee. UT Dallas faculty serving on the Discipline Commiteee are appointed by the academic senate, staff are named through a selection process, and students are selected through an application process.\nThe Dean decides whether the case will be heard by a Hearing Panel or a Hearing Officer. If a Hearing Panel will preside over the hearing, the following members of the Discipline Committee will serve:\n    \nAcademic Dishonesty: At least three members, consisting of faculty and students, and chaired by a faculty member;\nMisconduct violaitons: At least three members, consisiting of faculty, staff, and students, and chaired by a faculty or staff member;\nViolations of the Sexual Misconduct Policy [UTDBP3102]: At least three members consisting of faculty and staff.\n\n\nIf a Hearing Officer will preside over the hearing, the following members of the Discipline Committee will serve:\n    \nAcademic Dishonesty: One faculty member;\nMisconduct violations: One faculty or one staff member;\nViolations of the Sexual Misconduct Policy [UTDBP3102]: One faculty member or one staff member.\n\n\nA Hearing Panel or Hearing Officer is entitled have the advice and assistance of legal counsel from the Office of the General Counsel of the UT System and may request legal representation.\nA Hearing Panel or Hearing Officer shall: \n    \nmaintain an orderly hearing and permit no person to be subjected to abusive treatment and may eject or exclude anyone who refuses to be orderly;\nrender and provide the Dean and the respondent a written decision that contains findings of fact and a conclusion as to whether the respondent is responsible for the violations as charged;\nupon a finding of responsibility, assess the relevant sanction(s);\nin cases involving a crime of violence, notify the alleged victim of the decision. The alleged victim, upon receipt of information regarding the decision, shall be bound to keep in confidence such information; and\nparticipate in an annual training conducted by the Office of Community Standards and Conduct.\nA Hearing Panel chair abstains from voting unless a decision by the committee results in a draw.\n\n\n\nSubsection 15: Student Rights and Hearing Procedures\n\nThe following rights and procedures are provided to the respondent and/or complainant as specified: \n    \nThe respondent shall be given written notice of the time, place, and location of the hearing at least five (5) days in advance.\nThe respondent shall be advised in writing of the alleged violations of which they are being charged. \nAll parties will make available to the Dean of Students a list of witnesses, a summary of expected witness testimony, and copies of documents to be presented at the hearing at least three (3) days prior to the hearing. \nEach party shall have the right to appear, present documentary evidence, present and question witnesses and be assisted by one advisor of their choice. An advisor may not serve as a witness. An advisor may confer with and advise their respective party, but shall not be permitted to question witnesses, introduce evidence, make objections, or present arguments to the Hearing Panel or Hearing Officer. If the respondent's advisor is an attorney, the Dean's advisor may be an attorney from the Office of the General Counsel of the UT System. If the student chooses an advisor who is an attorney, the student must give notice of the name and address of the attorney to the Dean at least three (3) days before the time set for commencement of the hearing. \nThe respondent may challenge the impartiality of a member of the Hearing Panel or Hearing Officer. The challenge must state the reasons for the challenge, and be received through email by the Dean of Students at least three (3) days prior to the hearing. The member challenged shall determine whether they can serve with fairness and objectivity.\nFormal rules of evidence do not apply.

Some of UT Dallas' academic programs are designed to prepare students to apply for professional licensure or certification in Texas and may not meet education requirements for a license or certification for students who live in other states. According to NC-SARA Professional Licensure, \"states and other government entities have established standards of practice for the occupations or professions they have chosen to regulate, and they provide legal permission to practice those professions only to individuals who meet those standards. This is called professional licensure: professions for which people need to meet certain criteria in order to practice in that field.\"\nThe UT Dallas student's location is determined by the mailing address (not the home address) listed in the student record. If the UT Dallas student, who reside outside of Texas, is registered for a UT Dallas academic program in a licensure field, the student will receive a disclosure notification prior to the first day of enrolled courses if the program does not lead to licensure or certification in their location. If registration occurs after the first day of the semester, the student will receive a disclosure prior to Census Day.\nDue to frequent revisions of licensure regulations, you are strongly encouraged to contact the appropriate licensing entity in that state to obtain the most current information and guidance regarding that state's licensure and certification requirements before beginning an academic program. In addition to educational requirements, state licensure boards may require applicants to complete professional examinations, background checks, years of professional experience, jurisprudence exams, etc.\nIf you are considering a clinical or field experience in a state outside of Texas, state professional licensing board approval prior to beginning a clinical or field experience may be required in that state. Please check with your program's internship or clinical coordinator with questions about state professional licensing board requirements prior to beginning an internship or field experience in another state.\nIf you have any questions about professional licensure or certification, please reach out to the UT Dallas program contact listed below to assist you.\n\n\n\nDiscipline\n\n\nAcademic Program(s)\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\nMS in Accounting\n\n\nMary King\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBS in Human Resource\n\n\nJeff Weekley\n\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\nBA and BS in Education\nPost-baccalaureate Program in Teacher Certification\n\n\nBarbara Ashmore\nCarolyn Bray\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUTeach Dallas Programs\n\n\nHailey King\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMAT in Mathematics EducationMAT in Science Education\n\n\nEmily Hennessy\n\n\n\n\nEngineering\n\n\nBS in Biomedical Engineering\n\n\nDavid Schmidtke\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMS in Biomedical Engineering\n\n\nStuart Cogan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBS in Computer Engineering\n\n\nNaofal Al-Dhahir\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMS in Computer Engineering\n\n\nJ.B.

The marketable skills goal was designed to help students articulate their skills to employers.\n\nUT Dallas has identified marketable skills for all of its degree programs. The marketable skills on this website are organized by school, department, and program.

Donor privacy and safe handling of information are held in the highest regard.\nDonor Bill of Rights\nPhilanthropy is based on voluntary action for the common good. It is a tradition of giving and sharing that is primary to the quality of life. To ensure that philanthropy merits the respect and trust of the general public, and that donors and prospective donors can have full confidence in the nonprofit organizations and causes they are asked to support, we declare that all donors have these rights:\nI. To be informed of the organization\u2019s mission, of the way the organization intends to use donated resources and of its capacity to use donations effectively for their intended purposes.\nII. To be informed of the identity of those serving on the organization\u2019s governing board, and to expect the board to exercise prudent judgment in its stewardship responsibilities.\nIII. To have access to the organization\u2019s most recent financial statements.\nIV. To be assured their gifts will be used for the purposes for which they were given.\nV. To receive appropriate acknowledgement and recognition.\nVI. To be assured that information about their donation is handled with respect and with confidentiality to the extent provided by law.\nVII. To expect that all relationships with individuals representing organizations of interest to the donor will be professional in nature.\nVIII. To be informed whether those seeking donations are volunteers, employees of the organization or hired solicitors.\nIX. To have the opportunity for their names to be deleted from mailing lists that an organization may intend to share.\nX. To feel free to ask questions when making a donation and to receive prompt, truthful and forthright answers.\nThe text of this statement in its entirety was developed by the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel (AAFRC), Association for Healthcare Philanthropy (AHP), Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE) and the Association of Fundraising Professionals (AFP) and adopted in November 1993.\n\n\n\nContact Us\nPhone972-883-2295\nPhysical Address3000 Waterview ParkwayRichardson, TX 75080 Get Directions\nMailing Address800 W.

Individuals who encounter a physical, electronic, or programmatic barrier on campus, such as an inoperative elevator, an inaccessible website, a blocked access ramp, or any other access barrier, are encouraged to report it. Your help in identifying potential barriers is critical to our success.\nReport a barrier to access using the Report an Accessibility Barrier Form.\n\n\n\n\n\nReporting Suspected Noncompliance\n\n\n\nReport Suspected Noncompliance and Unethical Behavior\n\nThe Ethics and Compliance Hotline provides a confidential way for the campus community to report instances of suspected noncompliance or unethical behavior outside the normal chain of command. This may include financial matters such as fraud, theft of University assets, conflicts of interest, and other misconduct or violations of UT Dallas or UT System policy. Normal administrative methods, such as talking to your supervisor, are still important first-line approaches for reporting questionable activities. However, the hotline is available whenever conventional channels are unknown or unacceptable, or an employee wishes to remain anonymous. Please note: The hotline is not a complaint line. Only matters involving noncompliance, unethical, or fraudulent behavior will be investigated. Individuals who file grievances will be advised to pursue the normal administrative channels.\nClick here for the Hotline contact information.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf you are unsure which form to submit or would like additional information, please contact us at ICET@utdallas.edu or contact a staff member directly.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 The University of Texas at Dallas \u27e9 Institutional Compliance, Equity, and Title IX Initiatives\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

What is a \u201cResponsible Employee\u201d under UTD Policy?\nA Responsible Employee is a University employee who has the duty to report incidents of sexual misconduct to the Title IX Coordinator or other appropriate designee, or an employee whom an individual could reasonably believe has this duty.\nSee Section 3.2 of the Sexual Misconduct Policy (\u201cResponsible Employees\u201d).\n2. Who are the Responsible Employees at UTD?\nResponsible employees at UTD include all:\n\nAdministrators\nFaculty\nSupervisory staff\nResident life directors and advisors\nGraduate teaching assistants\nAny UTD employee whom an individual could reasonably believe has the duty to report incidents of sexual misconduct\n\nException: Physical and mental health care professionals and pastoral counselors are NOT Responsible Employees and are prohibited by confidentiality laws from reporting any information about an incident to anyone, in any way that identifies the complainant, without the complainant\u2019s permission. Examples of such employees at UTD include: counselors at the Student Counseling Center, the Galerstein Gender Center, and Employee Assistance Program (EAP), and healthcare professionals at the Student Health Center.\nAlthough only Responsible Employees are required to report sexual misconduct to the Title IX Coordinator or designee, all employees, students, and third parties without confidentiality obligations are strongly encouraged to immediately report any incidents of sexual misconduct to the Title IX Coordinator or Deputy Coordinator.\n See Section 3.2 of the Sexual Misconduct Policy (\u201cResponsible Employees\u201d).\n3. Why are Responsible Employees required to report incidents of sexual misconduct?\nReporting incidents of sexual misconduct helps us fulfill our commitment of maintaining a learning and working environment that is free from sex-based discrimination and harassment, including sexual violence.\n4. What must Responsible Employees include in their reports?\nResponsible Employees are required by law and University policy to report all relevant information that is known to the employee regarding possible sexual misconduct to the Title IX Coordinator or Deputy Title IX Coordinator, including the names of the complainant, respondent, and any witnesses; contact information for those individuals; the time, date and location of the incident(s); the nature of the misconduct; and any other relevant information.\n5. Do Responsible Employees have to let the complainant or other reporting party know that they are required to report?\nThough not specifically required in the Sexual Misconduct Policy, the Department of Education has advised that Responsible Employees should make every effort to ensure that the complainant understands: (i) the employee\u2019s obligation to report the names of the complainant and respondent, as well as relevant facts regarding the alleged incident (including the date, time, and location), to the Title IX Coordinator or Deputy Title IX Coordinator; (ii) the complainant\u2019s option to request that the school maintain his or her confidentiality; and (iii) the complainant\u2019s ability to share the information confidentially with confidential resources such as a counselor or healthcare professional.\nSee the Department of Education Office of Civil Rights, \u201cQuestions and Answers On Title IX and Sexual Violence\u201d at D-4 (April 29, 2014).\n6. How soon must Responsible Employees report alleged sexual misconduct once they receive information about an incident?\nResponsible Employees must report the alleged sexual misconduct to the Title IX Coordinator or Deputy Coordinator as soon as possible.\n7. If an incident happened a long time ago or happened off campus, does it still have to be reported?\nThere are no time period limitations under the Sexual Misconduct Policy, so the date of the alleged sexual misconduct is not relevant. Even if significant time has passed and the respondent is no longer on campus, a Responsible Employee must report the incident to the Title IX Coordinator or Deputy Coordinator to comply with University policy and the law.\nCertain off-campus conduct must be reported. Sexual misconduct alleged to have occurred off campus but at a UTD-sponsored or affiliated event or activity must always be reported. Examples of off-campus UTD-sponsored events and activities include, but are not limited to, study abroad programs, UTD-sanctioned student or employee travel, and athletic events. If the incident occurred at a location that is off campus and not a UTD-sponsored event or activity, it may still be required to be reported.\n8. What happens after a Responsible Employee makes a report to the Title IX Coordinator or Deputy Coordinator?\nThe Title IX Coordinator or Deputy Coordinator will contact the complainant to discuss:\n\nCampus and community resources;\nComplainant rights under University policy;\nComplaint and investigation process, and\nDetermine if immediate and/or interim measures are necessary.\n\nIf interim measures are determined to be appropriate, they will be taken immediately. For example, if the respondent is an employee, interim action may include reassignment or administrative leave for that employee. If the respondent is a student, interim action may include suspension, no contact orders, changing living arrangements, modifying the course schedule, or modifying other aspects of the educational environment. Interim action may also include allowing the complainant to move to a new residence hall, change work schedules, alter academic schedules, and withdraw from or retake a class without penalty. Moreover, the University may be able to provide additional accommodations for a complainant while an investigation is pending.\nSee Section 5.2 of the Sexual Assault Policy (\u201cInterim Measures and Ongoing Assistance\u201d).\n9. What if the complainant does not want the University to take any action regarding a report?\nInformal and formal resolutions are available options. In most cases, the matter will be immediately closed, and all information regarding the complaint, including the reporting party\u2019s identity, will be kept confidential. In rare circumstances, the Title IX Coordinator may determine that, based on information provided in a report a formal invesigation is necessary. The complainant will be notified of the investigation. The complainant may choose not to share additional information or otherwise participate.\n10. Is the information included in a Responsible Employee\u2019s report shared with the University Police Department?\nIdentifying information included in a responsible employee report will not be shared with the Police Department. In compliance with the Clery Act, a federal law that requires universities to collect and report statistical information regarding certain crimes committed on or around campus, including sexual assaults, basic non-identifying information will be provided to University Police as required.\nSee Section 3.3 of the Sexual Misconduct Policy (\u201cReporting to Law Enforcement\u201d).\n11. What if someone wants to discuss an incident of sexual misconduct without the information being reported to the Title IX Coordinator or Deputy Title IX Coordinator?\nIndividuals may share information with University employees who are subject to confidentiality laws, such as counselors, or with non-UTD affiliated individuals and organizations, without the information being reported to the Title IX Coordinator or Deputy Coordinator. Examples of confidential resources include:\n\nCounselors at the Student Counseling Center, the Galerstein Gender Center, and Employee Assistance Program (EAP),\nHealthcare professionals at the Student Health Center,\nOff-campus resources such as an individual\u2019s personal health care provider or counselor, clergyperson, a rape crisis resource center, or domestic violence shelter\n\nSee Section 3.5 of the Sexual Misconduct Policy (\u201cConfidential Support and Resources\u201d).\nInstitutional Compliance, Equity, and Title IX Initiatives maintains an updated list of campus and community resources.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 The University of Texas at Dallas \u27e9 Institutional Compliance, Equity, and Title IX Initiatives\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Sexual misconduct, Retaliation, and other conduct prohibited under this Policy will not be tolerated and will be subject to disciplinary action.\n1.2\tThe University will promptly discipline any individuals or organizations within its control who violate this Policy. The University encourages you to promptly report incidents that could constitute violations of this Policy to the Title IX Coordinator or (as outlined in Section 3.2 of this Policy).\n1.3 Free Speech: Freedom of speech and principles of academic freedom are central to the mission of institutions of higher education. Constitutionally protected expression cannot be considered Sexual Misconduct under this Policy.\nSEC. 2 Applicability and Scope\n2.1 Applicability: Policy applies to all University administrators, faculty, staff, students, and third parties within the University's control, including visitors and applicants for admission or employment. It applies to conduct that occurs on University owned or controlled premises, in an education program or activity including University sponsored or supported events, buildings owned or controlled by student organizations officially recognized by the University, or off campus when the conduct potentially affects a person's education or employment with the University or potentially poses a risk of harm to members of the University community. It also applies regardless of the gender, gender identity or sexual orientation of the parties.\n2.2 Prohibited Conduct under this Policy: Sexual Misconduct (which includes Sex Discrimination, Sexual Harassment, Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Stalking, and Other Inappropriate Sexual Conduct); Sexual Exploitation; Retaliation; Failure to Report (for a Responsible Employee); and False Information and False Complaints. Violations of Prohibited Conduct under this Policy will be adjudicated in accordance with this Policy. The definitions of Prohibited Conduct are in the Definitions Section of this Policy.\nSEC. 3 Reporting Incidents\n3.1\tGeneral Statement Empowering Community: This Policy distinguishes between reporting sexual misconduct incidents on the one hand and filing Formal Complaints on the other. Reporting Sexual Misconduct incidents informs the University of the incident, which allows the institution to provide Supportive Measures (as outlined in Section 5.2 of this Policy) to the Complainant and does not necessarily result in the initiation of the Grievance Process (as outlined in Section 6 of this Policy). All Complainants who report incidents of Sexual Misconduct will be offered individualized Supportive Measures. If Complainants wish to initiate the Grievance Process, they should file a Formal Complaint. As explained in more detail below (including exceptions and details as to applicability), generally speaking, the Grievance Process may involve an investigation into the incident and a hearing to determine the responsibility of the Respondent.\nAny person may report Sexual Misconduct, Retaliation, or other conduct prohibited under this Policy to the Title IX Coordinator. Any person may report an incident, whether or not the person reporting is the person alleged to be the victim of the incident, and it can be a verbal or written report to the Title IX Coordinator:\n\nMarco Mendoza\nTitleIXCoordinator@utdallas.edu\nPhone: 972-883-5202\nFax: 972-883-4470\nMailing Address\n800 W.

Your decision to remain anonymous, however, may greatly limit the University's ability to stop the alleged conduct, collect evidence, or take action against parties accused of violating this Policy.\nConfidentiality: You can discuss an incident in strict confidence by using  the confidential resources outlined in Section 3.4 of this Policy.\nTimeliness of Reporting:  Responsible Employees are required to report known incidents and information of Sexual Misconduct promptly to the Title IX Coordinator. For others in the University community, you are strongly encouraged to report Sexual Misconduct, Retaliation, and any other conduct prohibited under this Policy as soon as you become aware of such conduct.\n\n3.2 Reporting to Law Enforcement: You may also file a police report with The University of Texas at Dallas Police Department at (972) 883-2222 (non-emergency) or 911 (emergency) or to other local law enforcement authorities. The Title IX Office can help individuals contact these law enforcement agencies. Employees and students with protective or restraining orders relevant to a complaint are encouraged to provide a copy to the University Police Department.\n\n3.3 Reporting to Outside Entities:\nYou may also contact the following external agencies:\nFor Students:\n\nOffice for Civil Rights\nU.S. Department of Education\n1999 Bryan Street, Suite 1620\nDallas, TX 75201-6810\nPhone: (214-661-9600\nFax: 214-661-9587\nOffice for Civil Rights\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n1301 Young Street, Suite 1169\nDallas, TX  75202\nPhone:  (800) 537-7697\nFax: (214) 767-0432\n\nFor Employees:\n\nU.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\nDallas District Office\n207 S.

Employees may also seek assistance from the Employee Assistance Program, their own personal health care provider, the clergyperson of their choice, or an off-campus rape crisis resource without concern that the person's identity will be reported to the Title IX Office.\nThe University and community resources that provide confidential services are:\n\n\n\nStudent Counseling CenterSSB 4.600\n(972) 883-2575After hours helpline (972)-UTD-TALK\n\n\nStudent Health CenterSSB 4.700\n(972) 883-2747(972) 883-2747 (After Hours Nurse Line)\n\n\nDallas Area Rape Crisis Center (Dallas, TX)\n(972) 641-7273 (24-hour Crisis Hotline)\n\n\nThe Turning Point (Plano, TX)\n(800) 886-7273 (24-hour Crisis Hotline)\n\n\n\n3.5 Immunity: In an effort to encourage reporting of Sexual Misconduct, the University may grant immunity from student and/or employee disciplinary action to a person who acts in good faith in reporting an incident, filing a Formal Complaint, or participating a Grievance Process (e.g. investigation, hearing, appeal). This immunity does not extend to the person's own violations of this Policy.\nSEC. 4 Parties' Rights Regarding Confidentiality, Requests to Not Investigate, and Requests to Dismiss Formal Complaints\nThe University has great respect for the privacy of the parties identified in a report or Formal Complaint. Under state law, however, Responsible Employees who receive information of alleged Sexual Misconduct must share that information with the Title IX Coordinator. As such, the University may need to act to maintain campus safety and must determine whether to investigate further, regardless of the Complainant's request for confidentiality or request to not investigate a report received by the Title IX Coordinator.\nIn making determinations regarding requests for confidentiality, Complainants \u2018request to not investigate, Complainant's request to dismiss Formal Complaints and/or requests to not disclose identifying information to Respondents, the Title IX Coordinator must deliberately weigh the rights, interests, and safety of the Complainant, the Respondent, and the campus community. Factors the University must consider when determining whether to investigate an alleged incident of Sexual Misconduct include, but are not limited to:\n\nThe seriousness of the alleged incident;\nWhether the University has received other reports of alleged Sexual Misconduct by the alleged Respondent;\nWhether the alleged incident poses a risk or harm to others; and\nAny other factors the University determines relevant.\n\nUnder state law, if the Complainant requests in writing that the University not investigate a report, the University must inform the Complainant of the decision whether or not to investigate.\nIf the University dismisses a Formal Complaint (as outlined in Section 6.2(C) of this Policy), the University must provide the Complainant and Respondent a written notice of the dismissal and the reason(s) for the dismissal.\nIn the course of the Grievance Process, the University may share information only as necessary with people who need to know, in compliance with the law, which may include but is not limited to the investigators, witnesses, Complainant, Respondent, parties' advisors, hearing officer, and the appellate officer if applicable. The University will take all reasonable steps to ensure there is no retaliation against the parties or any other participants in the investigation or in any other part of the Grievance Process.\nSEC. 5 Resources and Assistance\n5.1 Immediate Assistance:\n\n\n\nUT Dallas Police Department\n(972) 883-2222 or 911\n\n\nStudent Counseling CenterSSB 4.600\n(972) 883-2575After hours helpline (972)-UTD-TALK\n\n\nStudent Health CenterSSB 4.700\n(972) 883-2747(972) 883-2747 (After Hours Nurse Line)\n\n\nDallas Area Rape Crisis Center (Dallas, TX)\n(972) 641-7273 (24-hour Crisis Hotline)\n\n\nThe Turning Point (Plano, TX)\n(800) 886-7273 (24-hour Crisis Hotline)\n\n\n\n\nHealthcare: If you experience sexual violence, you are encouraged to seek immediate medical care. Also, preserving DNA evidence can be key to identifying the perpetrator in a sexual violence case. Victims can undergo a  medical exam to preserve physical evidence with or without police involvement. If possible, this should be done immediately. If an immediate medical exam is not possible, individuals who have experienced a sexual assault may have a Sexual Assault Forensic Exam (SAFE) performed by a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) within 5 days (120 hours) of the incident. With the examinee's consent, the physical evidence collected during this medical exam can be used in a criminal investigation; however, you may receive a SAFE even if you choose not to contact police. To undergo a SAFE, go directly to the emergency department of the nearest hospital that provides SAFE services. Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Plano or Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas offers SAFE services and are located within 10 miles of the UTD campus. Additionally, UT Dallas students and staff may obtain a SAFE exam at the Student Health Center during normal business hours at no cost. For more information, contact the Student Health Center at (972) 883-2747 or see https://utdallas.edu/healthcenter/sane. You are strongly encouraged to seek medical care even if you do not plan to request a SAFE or report the assault to the police. You may be prescribed medications to prevent sexually transmitted infections and/or pregnancy, or provided other medical treatment.For more information about the SAFE, see https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/files/cvs/sexual_assault_examination.pdf. The cost of the forensic portion of the exam is covered by the law enforcement agency that is investigating the assault or, in cases in which a report will not be made to the police, the Texas Department of Public Safety. This does not include fees related to medical treatment that are not a part of the SAFE.\nPolice Assistance: If you experienced or witnessed sexual misconduct, the University encourages you to make a report to the police. The police may, in turn, share your report with the Title IX Office, with the exception of when you use a pseudonym form under the Code of Criminal Procedure for incidents of sexual assault, stalking, family violence, and human trafficking. In those instances, where a pseudonym form is used, the police will only report the type of incident to the Title IX Coordinator but not any information identifying you.A police department's geographic jurisdiction depends on where the incident occurred. Thus, if the incident occurred on the University campus, you may file a report with the University of Texas at Dallas Police Department by calling (972) 883-2222 or in person at UT Dallas Police headquarters at 800 W. Campbell Road, PD11, Richardson, TX 75080, even if time has passed since the incident occurred. The UT Dallas Police Department can also assist with filing any protective orders. For more information regarding protective orders, see https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/cvs/protective-orders.Reporting an incident to law enforcement does not mean the case will automatically go to criminal trial or go through a Grievance Process. If the University police are called, a police officer will be sent to the scene to take a detailed statement.

The Title IX Coordinator is responsible for administrative response to reports and Formal Complaints of Sexual Misconduct, Retaliation, and other conduct prohibited under this Policy. The Title IX Coordinator is available to discuss the Grievance Process, and coordinate Supportive Measures, explain University policies and procedures, and provide education on relevant issues. The Title IX Coordinator may designate one or more Deputy Title IX Coordinators to facilitate these responsibilities.Any member of the University community may contact the Title IX Coordinator with questions.\nInvestigator(s): The University will ensure that Formal Complaints are properly investigated under this Policy by investigators assigned to the Formal Complaint. The investigators are neutral and impartial fact-finders, and gather evidence during the investigation. The investigators are responsible for completing an investigation report at the conclusion of the investigation.\nHearing Panel/Officer: The hearing officer is responsible for conducting the hearing in an orderly manner, controlling the conduct of all participants and attendees of the hearing, and rendering a written determination regarding responsibility of the Respondent's alleged conduct charges in an impartial, neutral, and objective manner.\n\n6.2 Formal Complaints Against Students and Employees\n\nApplicability of the Grievance Process: The Grievance Process in this Policy applies to the following situations:\n    \nStudents: The Grievance Process in Sections 6.2 to 6.11 of this Policy applies in the instances where the Respondent is a student (including student employees) at the University at the time of the alleged conduct and where the conduct alleged includes Sexual Harassment. An alternative Grievance Process in Section 6.12 of this Policy applies in instances where the Respondent is a student at the time of the alleged conduct and where the conduct alleged does not include Sexual Harassment.\nEmployees: For employees, the Grievance Process in this Policy only applies where all of the following conditions are met; in all other instances, allegations of Sexual Misconduct will be handled in accordance with the UTDBP3090 (Nondiscrimination Policy):\n            \nThe Respondent is an employee at the University at the time of the alleged conduct;\nThe conduct alleged includes Sexual Harassment under this Policy;\nThe alleged conduct occurred against a person in the United States; andWhere the Complainant was participating or attempting to participate in an education program or activity at the University. This element is met if the conduct occurred in any of the following: on any University property; during any University activity; in a building owned or controlled by a student organization that is officially recognized by the University; or in instances where the University exercised substantial control over the Respondent and the context in which the alleged conduct occurred.\n\n\nTo begin the Grievance Process, the Complainant must sign a Formal Complaint (requesting an investigation) and submit it to the Title IX Coordinator. The Complainant must submit a written statement setting out the known details of the alleged conduct that is the subject of the Formal Complainant, including the following:\n            \nComplainant's name and contact information;\nRespondents name;\nDetailed description of the alleged conduct or event that is the basis of the alleged violation under this Policy;\nDate(s) and location(s) of the alleged occurrence(s);\nNames of any witnesses to the alleged occurrence(s); the resolution sought.The Complainant may also submit any documents or information that is relevant to the Formal Complaint.The Title IX Coordinator may also sign a Formal Complaint against a Respondent (requesting an investigation) and in doing so will initiate the Grievance Process. If the complaint is against the Senior Director/Title IX Coordinator, the complaint may be submitted to the Vice President and Chief of Staff.\n\n\nMandatory and Discretionary Formal Complaint Dismissals: \n            \nUnder Title IX regulations, universities are required to distinguish between prohibited conduct that is \"under Title IX\" and prohibited conduct that is a violation of university policy. Under Title IX, the University must dismiss a Formal Complaint or the part of the allegations in a Formal Complaint, if applicable, where:\n                    \nSexual Harassment is alleged and where:\n                            \nThe conduct alleged does not meet the definition of Sexual Harassment;\nThe alleged conduct did not occur in the University's education program or activity; or,\nThe alleged conduct did not occur against a person in the United States.A dismissal under this provision only applies to allegations of Sexual Harassment under Title IX. In such an instance, the University may still investigate a Formal Complaint for allegations of Sexual Harassment or other prohibited conduct under this Policy. The University may also investigate allegations of prohibited conduct under this Policy but it will not technically be \"under Title IX.\"\n\n\n\n\nThe University may dismiss a Formal Complaint, at its discretion, under this Policy's Grievance Process for any of the following circumstances:\n                    \nIf the Complainant requests in writing to dismiss a Formal Complaint (e.g. withdraws the Formal Complaint or any allegations therein), as outlined in Section 4 of this Policy;\nIf the Respondent was an employee and is no longer employed by the University at the time the Formal Complaint is filed;\nAny specific circumstances that prevent the University from gathering evidence sufficient to reach a determination as to the Formal Complaint or any allegations therein; or\nThe conduct alleged does not meet the definition of any prohibited conduct under this Policy.\n\n\nIf the University dismisses a Formal Complaint, the University must provide both parties a written notice of the dismissal and the reason(s) for the dismissal.\nConcurrent Criminal or Civil Proceedings. The University will not, as a matter of course, wait for the outcome of a concurrent criminal or civil justice proceeding to take action on a Formal Complaint in a University Grievance Process. The University has an independent duty to respond to Formal Complaints of Sexual Misconduct. At the University's discretion, the University may delay the investigation or Grievance Process for a brief period due to concurrent criminal or civil proceedings on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3 Written Notice of the Formal Complaint, and Notification of University Offices Offering Assistance\nAfter receiving a Formal Complaint, the Title IX Office will provide a written notice to the parties of the Formal Complaint  and available University resources and assistance.

The Informal Resolution entails the parties forgoing the Grievance Process (including the investigation and hearing, depending on when the parties agree to engage in an Informal Resolution). The Informal Resolution may include a mediation process, for example.\nAt any point prior to agreeing to an Informal Resolution, each party has a right to withdraw from the Informal Resolution process and resume the Grievance Process with respect to the Formal Complaint.\n\nInformal Resolution Availability: The Informal Resolution process is not permitted in cases where Sexual Harassment is alleged in the Formal Complaint.

A determination that a Respondent is not responsible for the allegations of Sexual Misconduct does not imply a report was false. Similarly, a determination that a Respondent is responsible for a policy violation does not imply that a Respondent's statements disclaiming responsibility were false.\n9.3\tInterference with the Grievance Process: Any person who interferes with a Grievance Process (as outlined in Section 6 of this Policy) is subject to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal or separation from the University. Interference with a Grievance Process may include, but is not limited to:\n\nAttempting to coerce, compel, or prevent an individual from providing testimony or relevant information;\nRemoving, destroying, or altering documentation relevant to the Grievance Process; or\nKnowingly providing false or misleading information to the Title IX Coordinator, investigator, or hearing officer, or encouraging others to do so.\n\n9.4 Failure to Report for Responsible Employees: Under state law, If a Responsible Employee knowingly fails to report all information concerning an incident the employee reasonably believes constitutes stalking, dating violence, sexual assault, or sexual harassment committed by or against a student or employee at the time of the incident, the employee is subject to disciplinary action, including termination.\nFor the purposes of Failure to Report, the definition of sexual harassment as defined under state law, is broader than the definition of sexual harassment under this Policy and is defined as Unwelcome, sex-based verbal or physical conduct that:\n\nin the employment context, unreasonably interferes with a person's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment; or\nin the education context, it is sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive that the conduct interferes with a student's ability to participate in or benefit from educational programs or activities at a postsecondary institution.\n\n9.5 No Effect on Pending Personnel or Academic Actions Unrelated to the Complaint: The filing of a Formal Complaint under this Policy will not stop or delay any action unrelated to the Formal Complaint, including: (1) any evaluation or disciplinary action relating to a complainant who is not performing up to acceptable standards or who has violated University rules or policies; (2) any evaluation or grading of students participating in a class, or the ability of a student to add/drop a class, change academic programs, or receive financial reimbursement for a class; or (3) any job-related functions of a University employee. Nothing in this section shall limit the University's ability to take interim action or execute an emergency removal.\nDefinitions and Examples\nCoercion: The use of pressure to compel another individual to initiate or continue sexual activity against an individual's will. Coercion can include a wide range of behaviors, including psychological or emotional pressure, physical or emotional threats, intimidation, manipulation, or blackmail that causes the person to engage in unwelcome sexual activity. A person's words or conduct are sufficient to constitute coercion if they eliminate a reasonable person's freedom of will and ability to choose whether or not to engage in sexual activity. Examples of coercion include but are not limited to threatening to \"out\" someone based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression; threatening to harm oneself if the other party does not engage in the sexual activity; threatening to disclose someone's highly personal images; threatening to disclose sensitive details about one's sexual preferences, habits and/or experiences; threatening to expose someone's prior sexual activity to another person.\nComplainant: The individual who is alleged to be the victim of any prohibited conduct under this Policy.\nConfidential Employees: Confidential Employees include counselors in Counseling and Psychological Services, a health care provider in Health Services, or clergypersons. Additionally, employees who receive information regarding an incident of sexual misconduct under circumstances that render the employee's communications confidential or privileged under other law (such as attorneys) are also considered \"Confidential Employees.\"\nNote: Under state law, Confidential Employees who receive information regarding incidents of sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence or stalking committed by or against a student or an employee of the University, are required to report the type of incident to the Title IX Coordinator. Confidential Employees may not include any information that would violate a student's expectation of privacy. The Confidential Employee's duty to report an incident under any other law also applies.\nConsent: A voluntary, mutually understandable agreement that clearly indicates a willingness to engage in each instance of sexual activity. Consent to one act does not imply consent to another. Consent to engage in sexual activity with one person does not imply consent to engage in sexual activity with another. Consent can be withdrawn at any time. Any expression of an unwillingness to engage in any instance of sexual activity establishes a presumptive lack of consent.\nConsent is not effective if it results from:  (a) the use of physical force, (b) a threat of physical force, (c) intimidation, (d) coercion, (e) incapacitation or (f) any other factor that would eliminate an individual's ability to exercise his or her own free will to choose whether or not to have sexual activity.\nA current or previous dating or sexual relationship, by itself, is not sufficient to constitute consent. Even in the context of a relationship, there must be a voluntary, mutually understandable agreement that clearly indicates a willingness to engage in each instance of sexual activity.\nDating Violence: Violence committed by a person who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the victim. The existence of such a relationship shall be determined based on the consideration of the following factors:\n\nThe length of the relationship;\nThe type of relationship; and\nThe frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the relationship.\n\nDating violence includes, but is not limited to, sexual or physical abuse or the threat of such abuse. It does not include acts covered under the definition of domestic violence.\nDomestic (Family) Violence: Includes felony or misdemeanor crimes of violence committed by a current or former spouse or intimate partner of the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse or intimate partner, by a person similarly situated to a spouse of the victim under the domestic or family violence laws of the state of Texas, or by any other person against an adult or youth victim who is protected from that person's acts under the domestic or family violence laws of the state of Texas.\nHostile Environment: exists when sexual misconduct is sufficiently severe or pervasive to deny or limit the individual's ability to participate in or benefit from an education program or activity or an employee's terms and conditions of employment. A hostile environment can be created by anyone (e.g., administrators, faculty members, employees, students, and University visitors) involved in an education program or activity or work environment.\nIn determining whether sexual misconduct has created a hostile environment, the University considers the conduct in question from both a subjective and objective perspective. It will be necessary, but not adequate, that the conduct was unwelcome to the individual who was mistreated. To conclude that conduct created or contributed to a hostile environment, the University must also find that a reasonable person in the individual's position would have perceived the conduct as undesirable or offensive.\nTo ultimately determine whether a hostile environment exists for an individual or individuals, the University may consider a variety of factors related to the severity, persistence, or pervasiveness of the sexual misconduct, including: (1) the type, frequency, and duration of the conduct; (2) the identity and relationships of the persons involved; (3) the number of individuals involved; (4) the location of the conduct and the context in which it occurred; and (5) the degree to which the conduct affected an individual's education or employment.\nThe more severe the sexual misconduct, the less need there is to show a repetitive series of incidents to find a hostile environment. Indeed, a single instance of sexual assault may be sufficient to create a hostile environment. Likewise, a series of incidents may be sufficient even if the sexual misconduct is not particularly severe.\nIncapacitation: Incapacitation is the inability, temporarily or permanently, to give consent because the individual is mentally and/or physically helpless, either voluntarily or involuntarily, or the individual is unconscious, asleep, or otherwise unaware that the sexual activity is occurring. An individual may be incapacitated if they are unaware at the time of the incident of where they are, how they got there, or why or how they became engaged in a sexual interaction.\nWhen alcohol is involved, incapacitation is a state beyond drunkenness or intoxication. When drug use is involved, incapacitation is a state beyond being under the influence or impaired by use of the drug. Alcohol and other drugs impact each individual differently, and determining whether an individual is incapacitated requires an individualized determination.\nAfter establishing that a person is in fact incapacitated, the University asks two questions:\n\nDid the person initiating sexual activity know that the other party was incapacitated? And if not,\nShould a sober, reasonable person in the same situation have known that the other party was incapacitated?\n\nIf the answer to either of these questions is \"YES,\" consent was absent and the conduct is likely a violation of this Policy.\nA Respondent will be found to have violated policy only if the Respondent knew or should have known that the person was incapacitated.\nIntimidation: Unlawfully placing another person in reasonable fear of bodily harm through the use of threatening words and/or other conduct, but without displaying a weapon or subjecting the victim to actual physical attack.\nOther Inappropriate Sexual Conduct: Conduct on the basis of sex that does not meet the definition of \"sexual harassment\" under this Policy, but is\n\nIf verbal conduct (including through electronic means), unwanted statements of a sexual nature intentionally stated to a person or group of people, that are objectively offensive to a reasonable person and also so severe or pervasive that they created a Hostile Environment, as defined in this Policy. The type of verbal conduct (if all other elements are met) may include:\n            \nUnwelcome sexual advances (including explicit or implicit proposition(s) of sexual contact or activity);\nRequests for sexual favors (including overt or subtle pressure);\nGratuitous comments about an individual's sexual activities or speculation about an individual's sexual experiences;\nGratuitous comments, jokes, questions, anecdotes or remarks of a sexual nature about clothing or bodies;\nPersistent, unwanted sexual or romantic attention;\nExposure to sexually suggestive visual displays such as photographs, graffiti, posters, calendars or other materials; or\nDeliberate, repeated humiliation or intimidation.\n\n\nIf physical conduct, either:\n            \nSexual exploitation, as defined in this Policy;\nUnwelcome intentional touching of a sexual nature;\nDeliberate physical interference with or restriction of movement; or\nSexual violence as defined in this Policy.\n\n\n\nParticipants: The term \"participants\" includes the Complainant, Respondent, and any witnesses.\nParties:  The term \"parties\" refers to the \"Complainant\" and the \"Respondent\" under this Policy.\nPreponderance of the Evidence: The greater weight of the credible evidence. Preponderance of the evidence is the standard for determining allegations of prohibited conduct under this Policy. This standard is satisfied if the action is deemed more likely to have occurred than not.\nRespondent:  The individual who has been reported to be the perpetrator of prohibited conduct under this Policy.\nResponsible Employee: A University employee who has the duty to report incidents of and information reasonably believed to be Sexual Misconduct to the Title IX Coordinator. All employees are Responsible Employees except Confidential Employees. Responsible Employees include all administrators, faculty, staff, residential life staff, peer advisors, graduate teaching assistants, graduate research assistants, academic advisors, UT Dallas police officers, public safety officers, and athletic coaches and staff. Responsible Employees must report all known information concerning the incident to the Title IX Office, and must include whether a Complainant has expressed a desire for confidentiality in reporting the incident.\nRetaliation: Any adverse action (including, but is not limited to, intimidation, threats, coercion, harassment, or discrimination) taken against someone because the individual has made a report or filed a Formal Complaint; or who has supported or provided information in connection with a Formal Complaint; participated or refused to participate in a Grievance Process under this Policy; or engaged in other legally protected activities.\nSex Discrimination: Occurs when an individual is treated less favorably on the basis of that person's sex (including gender), which may also include on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, or expression, pregnancy or pregnancy-related condition, or a sex stereotype. Sexual harassment, as defined in this Policy, is a form of sex discrimination.\nSexual Assault: An offense that meets the definition of rape, fondling, incest, or statutory rape:\n\nRape: The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.\nFondling: The touching of the private body parts of another person for the purpose of sexual gratification, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of his/her age or because of his/her temporary or permanent mental incapacity.\nIncest: Sexual intercourse between persons who are related to each other within the degrees wherein marriage is prohibited by law.\nStatutory Rape: Sexual intercourse with a person who is under the statutory age of consent.\n\nSexual Exploitation: Conduct where an individual takes non-consensual or abusive sexual advantage of another for their own benefit, or to benefit anyone other than the one being exploited. Examples of sexual exploitation include, but are not limited to, engaging in voyeurism; forwarding of pornographic or other sexually inappropriate material by email, text, or other channels to non-consenting students/groups; the intentional removal of a condom or other contraceptive barrier during sexual activity without the consent of a sexual partner; and any activity that goes beyond the boundaries of consent, such as recording of sexual activity, letting others watch consensual sex, or knowingly transmitting a sexually transmitted disease (STD) to another.\nSexual Harassment: Conduct on the basis of sex that satisfies one or more of the following:\n\nQuid pro quo: An employee of the institution conditioning the provision of an aid, benefit, or service of the University on an individual's participation in unwelcome sexual conduct;\nUnwelcome conduct determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the University's education program or activity; or\n\"Sexual assault,\" \"dating violence,\" \"domestic violence,\" or \"stalking\" as defined in this Policy.\n\nSubsections (a) and (c) in this definition are not evaluated for severity, pervasiveness, offensiveness, or denial of equal educational access, because such conduct is sufficiently serious to deprive a person of equal access. Therefore, any instance of quid pro quo sexual harassment and any instance of sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking are considered sexual harassment under this Policy.\nSexual Misconduct: This term is broadly defined to encompass sex discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, and other Inappropriate Sexual Conduct.\nSexual Violence: Physical sexual acts perpetrated against a person's will or where a person is incapable of giving consent. The term includes, but is not limited to, rape, sexual assault, sexual coercion, sexual abuse, indecency with a child, and/or aggravated sexual assault.\nStalking: Engaging in a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to fear for his or her safety or the safety of others, or suffer substantial emotional distress. For the purposes of this definition:\n\nCourse of conduct means two or more acts, including, but not limited to, acts in which the stalker directly, indirectly, or through third parties, by any action, method, device, or means, follows, monitors, observes, surveils, threatens, or communicates to or about a person, or interferes with a person's property;\nReasonable person means a reasonable person under similar circumstances and with similar identities to the victim; and\nSubstantial emotional distress means significant mental suffering or anguish that may, but does not necessarily, require medical or other professional treatment or counseling.\n\nAppendix A\nContact Information:\nQuestions or comments regarding this policy should be directed to the Title IX Coordinator (TitleIXCoordinator@utdallas.edu).\nRelevant Federal and State Statutes and Standards\n\nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1681\u20131688 and its implementing regulations, 34 C.F.R.

If faculty have additional questions about FERPA guidance, please contact the Office of the Registrar at records@utdallas.edu for the proper student consent forms and further instructions.

Per university policy, Sexual Misconduct Policy - UTDBP3102, faculty have been informed that they must identify the student to the UT Dallas Title IX Coordinator.

Additional information is available from the office of the school dean.\nStudent Conduct and Discipline\nThe University of Texas System (Regents' Rule 50101) and UT Dallas have rules and regulations for the orderly and efficient conduct of their business. It is the responsibility of each student and each student organization to be knowledgeable about the rules and regulations which govern student conduct and activities. General information on student conduct and discipline is contained in the Student Complaints Resources in the online UT Dallas Undergraduate Catalog, https://catalog.utdallas.edu/now/undergraduate/resources/student-complaints and the Graduate Catalog, https://catalog.utdallas.edu/now/graduate/resources/student-complaints.\nUT Dallas administers student discipline within the procedures of recognized and established due process. Procedures are defined and described in the Student Code of Conduct, UTDSP5003 (https://policy.utdallas.edu/utdsp5003). Copies of these rules and regulations are available to students in the Office of Community Standards and Conduct, where staff members are available to assist students in interpreting the rules and regulations (SSB 4.400, 972-883-6330) and online at https://conduct.utdallas.edu.\nA student at the University neither loses their rights nor escapes the responsibilities of citizenship. He or she is expected to obey federal, state, and local laws as well as the Regents' Rules, university regulations, and administrative rules. Students are subject to discipline for violating its standards of conduct whether such conduct takes place on or off campus, or whether civil or criminal penalties are also imposed for such conduct.\nSocial Media Use\nThe Student Code of Conduct includes behaviors conducted via any digital platform. Students may not use any digital platform to seek or provide unauthorized assistance for any assignment done for academic credit. Students may not use any digital platform to impersonate or represent any person other than themselves. Please consult with your instructor regarding authorized assistance.\nAcademic Integrity\nThe faculty expects from its students a high-level of responsibility and academic honesty. Because the value of an academic degree depends upon the absolute integrity of the work done by the student for that degree, it is imperative that a student demonstrates a high standard of individual honor in his or her scholastic work. See https://conduct.utdallas.edu/integrity.\nAcademic Dishonesty: Academic dishonesty can occur in relation to any type of work submitted for academic credit or as a requirement for a class. It can include individual work or a group project. Academic dishonesty includes plagiarism, cheating, fabrication, and collaboration/collusion. In order to avoid academic dishonesty, it is important for students to fully understand the expectations of their professors. This is best accomplished through asking clarifying questions if an individual does not completely understand the requirements of an assignment.\nAdditional information related to academic dishonesty and tips on how to avoid dishonesty may be found here: https://conduct.utdallas.edu/dishonesty.\nCopyright Notice\nIt is the policy of UT Dallas to adhere to the requirements of the United States Copyright Law of 1976, as amended, (Title 17, United States Code), including ensuring that the restrictions that apply to the reproduction of software are adhered to and that the bounds of copying permissible under the fair use doctrine are not exceeded. Copying, displaying, reproducing, or distributing copyrighted material may infringe upon the copyright owner's rights. Unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material, including unauthorized peer-to-peer file sharing, may subject students to appropriate disciplinary action as well as civil and criminal penalties. Usage of such material is only appropriate when that usage constitutes \"fair use\" under the Copyright Act. For more information about the fair use exemption, see https://guides.lib.utexas.edu/fairuse/home. As a UT Dallas student, you are required to follow UT Dallas' copyright policy (UTDPP1043 at https://policy.utdallas.edu/utdpp1043) and the UT System's policy, UTS107 at https://www.utsystem.edu/board-of-regents/policy-library/policies/uts107-use-copyrighted-materials.\nEmail Use\nUT Dallas recognizes the value and efficiency of communication between faculty/staff and students through electronic mail. At the same time, email raises some issues concerning security and the identity of each individual in an email exchange. All official student email correspondence will be sent only to a student's UT Dallas email address and UT Dallas will only consider email requests originating from an official UT Dallas student email account. This allows the University to maintain a high degree of confidence in the identity of each individual corresponding via email and the security of the transmitted information. UT Dallas furnishes each student with a free email account that is to be used in all communication with university personnel. The Office of Information Technology provides a method for students to have their UT Dallas mail forwarded to other email accounts. To activate a student UT Dallas computer account and forward email to another account, go to https://oit.utdallas.edu/netid/self-service.\nClass Attendance\nThe University's attendance policy requirement is that individual faculty set their course attendance requirements. Regular and punctual class attendance is expected regardless of course modality. Students who fail to attend class regularly are inviting scholastic difficulty. In some courses, instructors may have special attendance requirements; these should be made known to students during the first week of classes.\nClass Participation\nRegular class participation is expected regardless of course modality. Students who fail to participate in class regularly are inviting scholastic difficulty. A portion of the grade in the course is directly tied to class participation. It also includes students' engagement in group or other activities during class that solicit feedback on homework assignments, readings, and/or materials covered in the lectures and/or labs. Class participation is documented by faculty. Successful class participation is defined as consistently adhering to University requirements, as presented in the syllabus. Failure to comply with these University requirements is a violation of the Student Code of Conduct - UTSP5003.\nCredit/No Credit and Pass/Fail Grading Options\nStudents are encouraged to review the online catalogs regarding Credit/No Credit or Pass/Fail courses. Students should consult their academic advisors to understand what it means for their academic careers before completing the form prior to Census Day.\nUndergraduate students: please review the Credit/No Credit Classes section in the Undergraduate Catalog.\nGraduate students: please review the Pass/Fail Grading section in the Graduate Catalog.\nWithdrawal from Class\nThe administration at UT Dallas has established deadlines for withdrawal from any course. These dates and times are published in the Comet Calendar (http://www.utdallas.edu/calendar) and in the Academic Calendar (http://www.utdallas.edu/academiccalendar). It is the student's responsibility to handle withdrawal requirements from any class. In other words, a professor or another instructor cannot drop or withdraw any student unless there is an administrative drop such as the following:\n\nNot meeting the prerequisites for a specific course\nNot satisfying the academic probationary requirements, resulting in suspension\nAn Office of Community Standards and Conduct request\nNot making appropriate tuition and fee payments\nEnrollment is in violation of academic policy\nNot admitted for the term in which they registered\n\nIt is the student's responsibility to complete and submit the appropriate forms to the Registrar's Office and ensure that he or she will not receive a final grade of \"F\" in a course if he or she chooses not to attend the class after being enrolled.\nUndergraduate students: please review the Dropping and Withdrawing section in the catalog.\nGraduate students: please review the Schedule Changes: Dropping, Adding and Withdrawing from Courses section in the catalog.\nStudent Grievance Procedures\nProcedures for student grievances are found in university policy UTDSP5005 (https://policy.utdallas.edu/utdsp5005). In attempting to resolve any student grievance regarding disputes over grades, application of degree plan, graduation/degree program requirements, and thesis/and dissertation committee, adviser actions and/or decisions, evaluations, and/or other fulfillments of academic responsibility, it is the obligation of the student first to make a serious effort to resolve the matter with the instructor, supervisor, administrator, or committee with whom the grievance originated.\nIncomplete Grade Policy\nAs per university policy, incomplete grades may be given at the discretion of the instructor of record for a course, when a student has completed at least 70% of the required course material but cannot complete all requirements by the end of the semester. An incomplete course grade (grade of 'I') must be completed within the time period specified by the instructor, not to exceed eight (8) weeks from the first day of the subsequent long semester. Upon completion of the required work, the grade of 'I' may be converted into a letter grade (A through F). If the grade of Incomplete is not removed by the end of the specified period, it will automatically be changed to a grade of F. The incomplete grade policy is included in the online UT Dallas Undergraduate Catalog, https://catalog.utdallas.edu/now/undergraduate/policies/academic#incomplete-grades and the Graduate Catalog, https://catalog.utdallas.edu/now/graduate/policies/grades#grade-of-i-incomplete.\nAccommodations for Students with Disabilities\nThe University of Texas at Dallas is committed to providing reasonable accommodations for all persons with disabilities. The syllabus is available in alternate formats upon request. If you are seeking classroom accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act (2008), you are required to register with the Office of Student AccessAbility (OSA), located in the Administration Building, Suite 2.224. Their phone number is 972-883-2098, email: studentaccess@utdallas.edu and the website is https://studentaccess.utdallas.edu. To receive academic accommodations for this class, please obtain the proper Office of Student AccessAbility letter of accommodation and meet with the Director of OSA at the beginning of the semester.\nReligious Holy Days\nUT Dallas will excuse a student from class or other required activities, including examinations and travel time for the observance of a religious holy day for a religion whose places of worship are exempt from property tax under Section 11.20, of the Texas Tax Code.\nStudents are encouraged to notify the instructor or activity sponsor as soon as possible regarding the absence, preferably in advance of the assignment.\nExcused students will be allowed to take missed exams or complete assignments within a reasonable time after the absence: a period equal to the length of the absence, up to a maximum of one week. A student who notifies the instructor and completes any missed exam or assignment may not be penalized for the absence. A student who fails to complete the exam or assignment within the prescribed period may receive a failing grade for that exam or assignment.\nIf a student or an instructor disagrees about the nature of the absence [i.e., for the purpose of observing a religious holy day] or if there is similar disagreement about whether the student has been given a reasonable time to complete any missed assignments or examinations, either the student or the instructor may request a ruling from the President of UT Dallas or from the President's designee. The chief executive officer or designee must take into account the legislative intent of Texas Education Code 51.911(b), and the student and instructor will abide by the decision of the chief executive officer or designee.\nThis information is also included in the online UT Dallas Undergraduate Catalog, https://catalog.utdallas.edu/now/undergraduate/policies/religious-holy-days, and the Graduate Catalog, https://catalog.utdallas.edu/now/graduate/policies/religious-holy-days.\nMaking a False Alarm or Report Involving a Public or Private Institution of a Higher Education\nMaking a false threat at any Texas higher education institution is considered a State Jail Felony, not a Class A misdemeanor, according to a law passed by the Texas Legislature.\nThis legislation was enacted in response to several threats in past years at several universities across the U.S. that disrupted classes and prompted evacuation of campus property, even though the reports turned out to be a hoax.\nThis law relates to the offense of making or causing a false alarm or report involving a public or private institution of higher education. A person commits an offense under Section 42.06, Texas Penal Code, if he or she knowingly initiates, communicates or circulates a report of a present, past, or future bombing, fire, offense, or other emergency that he or she knows is false or baseless and that would ordinarily:\n\nCause action by an official or volunteer agency organized to deal with emergencies;\nPlace a person in fear of imminent serious bodily injury; or\nPrevent or interrupt the occupation of a building, room, place of assembly, place to which the public has access, or aircraft, automobile, or other mode of conveyance.\n\nAn individual adjudged guilty of a state jail felony shall be punished by confinement in a state jail for any term of not more than two years or less than 180 days and, in addition to confinement, may be punished by a fine not to exceed $10,000.\nUT Dallas students should be aware that the State of Texas takes these threats seriously, and the legal consequences, which are severe, go beyond anything that the University's disciplinary committee can address.\nThis information is also included in the online UT Dallas Undergraduate Catalog, https://catalog.utdallas.edu/now/undergraduate/policies/false-alarms and in the Graduate Catalog, https://catalog.utdallas.edu/now/graduate/policies/false-alarms.\nInteractive Campus Map \u2013 Locate Severe Weather Shelters, Elevators, and Bathrooms\nThe interactive campus map (https://map.utdallas.edu) allows users to search for severe weather shelter areas in each building. On the map, click on a building and select \"Storm Shelters\" from the \"Find\" drop-down menu. Remember, a severe weather shelter area is usually any interior room without windows, such as a restroom, hallway, conference room, or office. Try to find shelter on the lowest floor of the building and stay away from large auditoriums or gyms. Users can also use the same map to locate elevators and bathrooms.\nAcademic Support Resources\nResources to Help You Succeed\nInstructors of record: Please use the following permanent address when referring to this section: https://go.utdallas.edu/academic-support-resources\nAll Students\nFor help with a research assignment, such as finding journal articles or using a database, try CHAT at McDermott Library.\nThe Center for Students in Recovery helps students seeking recovery from substance and alcohol use, eating disorders, and other addictions and compulsive behaviors.

Students enrolled in Master's degree programs must have a completed \"Program of Studies/Degree Plan\" filed in and approved by the Office of the Dean of Graduate Education prior to the student's registration for his or her 19th semester credit hour in the degree program. The form will be completed and revised, if necessary, each semester under the guidance of the student's graduate advisor. For each student enrolled in a doctoral degree program, the academic advisor in consultation with the student, will prepare and submit a completed and updated \"Milestones Agreement Form\" annually to the office of the Dean of Graduate Education. The completed form will define academic milestones and timeline required to earn the doctoral degree and the progress being made by the student in meeting each requirement.\n    \nException: Common Master's Program: In those Graduate Programs where a common program of studies is prescribed for all Master's students, differing only in elective courses comprising less than one-third of the total required degree semester credit hours, the Graduate Program can file a model \"Program of Studies\" with the Office of the Dean of Graduate Education. Any student wishing to deviate from that approved model Program of Studies must file an Individual Program of Studies developed and approved by the appropriate committee or administrator for that program prior to the student's registration for his or her 19th degree semester hour taken at UT Dallas.\nException: Common Doctoral Core: In those Graduate Programs where a common doctoral core is prescribed for all students, differing only by the area of specialization chosen, the Graduate Program can file a model \"Program of Studies\" with the Office of the Dean of Graduate Education. Any student wishing to deviate from that approved model Program of Studies must file an Individual Program of Studies developed and approved by the appropriate committee or administrator for that program prior to the student's registration for his or her 50th degree semester hour taken at UT Dallas.\nAdditional Master's Degrees: Students wishing to earn additional Master's degrees at UT Dallas must develop an approved Program of Studies through the Program offering that degree prior to enrolling in additional courses. The only limitation is that more than one-half of the semester credit hours for any master's degree earned at UT Dallas must be satisfied by new coursework. Additional credits may be accepted from the previous degree upon the approval of the Dean of Graduate Education. In no case will credits counted for a previous degree be allowed to exceed one-half the total hours required for the additional Master's degree program.\nGraduation Under a Particular Catalog: Provided the requisite courses continue to be offered, the student is bound by the course work requirements of the catalog in force at the time of admission, within a six-year limit for the completion of the Master's degree and ten years for the doctoral degree. With the approval of the Dean of Graduate Education the student may elect to be bound by the catalog in force at the time the student applies for graduation. This regulation applies to specific course work and the number of semester credit hours for the academic degrees set forth in the catalog. All other requirements will change or be continued with the issuance of new graduate catalogs.\n\n\nTRANSFER CREDIT: To qualify for transfer credit, the grade earned in the course must be a B or better and the course must not be a correspondence, extension or pass/fail course. UT Dallas awards academic credit for non-credit coursework not originating from the institution only in instances in which signed agreements are on file as outlined in the Graduate Catalog. Petitions for transfer of credit must be prepared by the Graduate Program and submitted for approval by the program faculty and the School Associate Dean of Graduate Studies. Petitions may be approved at the time of the student's first enrollment; however, no actual acceptance of transfer credit will occur until after the student has completed 9 semester credit hours of courses at UT Dallas with a grade point average of at least 3.0. Petitions for transferring courses taken before enrolling as a graduate student at UT Dallas must be submitted prior to filing the Program of Studies. Petitions for transfer credit must be accompanied by a copy of the student's transcript showing the course(s) in question.\n    \nNo more than 25% of the total requirement of a Master's degree may be transfer credits. Some degree programs have more restrictive transfer of credit requirements.\nDoctoral Degree: A Master's degree or its equivalent may be transferred from another university for up to 36 semester hours of credit towards a doctoral degree.\nNon-Degree Students: No more than 15 semester credit hours taken as a Non-Degree Student may be subsequently transferred to a degree program at UT Dallas. No petition is necessary for any of this coursework to be included in a student's Program of Studies.\nExceptions: Exceptions to these transfer policies may be granted only on petition to the Dean of Graduate Education. Such a petition could be for the program of an individual student or for the model Program of Studies (See \"Exceptions\" on page 1 of this policy).\n\n\nDEGREE REQUIREMENTS: The student will complete the course work degree requirements when he or she completes the previously filed program of studies with acceptable grades.\n    \nRequired Semester Credit Hours: The minimum required semester credit hours in a Program of Studies required for the degree will be those shown in the catalog applicable to the student at the time of his or her admission or readmission to the program. In no case will a student be allowed to graduate with less than 30 approved graduate semester credit hours (including approved graduate transfer credit hours) for the Master's degree.\nRequired Grade Point Average: In order to qualify for graduation, students must maintain a 3.0 grade point average in their degree program's core courses. However, individual programs may have more stringent grade point requirements in selected courses, which must be satisfied for graduation. The minimum acceptable University grade point average for graduation is 3.0 for all graduate courses taken at UT Dallas. Students changing graduate programs may petition the Graduate Dean to qualify for graduation if their cumulative grade point average is below a 3.00.\nResearch Involving Animal or Human Subjects\n        \nResearch Involving the Use of Animals (UTDPP1014): Any student who intends to conduct research, (whether funded or not funded) which would involve animals must obtain permission from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Permission to use an animal in research must be obtained prior to ordering, bringing to campus or housing on campus an animal. The required form to request approval may be obtained from the Office of Research Compliance.\nResearch Involving Human Subjects (UTDPP1035): Any student who intends to conduct research, on or off campus, in partial or complete fulfillment of a course requirement, thesis or dissertation, which would involve human beings as subjects must obtain permission, prior to undertaking the research, from the University's Institutional Review Board for the Protection of Human Subjects (IRB). Any research activity, including but not limited to surveys, questionnaires, interviews, standardized and non-standardized tests, and/or simple research experiments, which include the participation of human beings, regardless of age of participant, must have approval from the IRB. The required forms to request approval may be obtained from the Office of Research Compliance.\n\n\nAdmission to Doctoral Candidacy: The research potential and ability of each doctoral student to both understand and integrate coursework and relevant scholarship will be evaluated before a student can be admitted formally to doctoral candidacy. The format of this evaluation, hereafter referred to as a qualifying examination, varies amongst the degree programs, and can be obtained from the student's Graduate Program Office. A student failing the Qualifying Examination is terminated as a doctoral student in that program unless a two-thirds majority of the examining committee vote that a second examination be permitted. All committee members should have all the evidence of the student's academic record and Qualifying Examination performance prior to this vote. The second must be taken no sooner than two months after the student receives the written results of the first examination, and no later than one year after the first examination. Students failing the second examination will not be allowed to pursue a doctoral degree in that program. Under no circumstances will a third examination be allowed. The student will have advanced to candidacy when the student has\n        \npassed the qualifying examination,\nbeen assigned an approved Supervising Committee, and\nsatisfied any other Program or School candidacy requirements.: Candidacy must be achieved before a student is eligible to enroll in dissertation courses.\n\n\n\n\nTHESIS AND DISSERTATION REQUIREMENT\n    \nOutcome of the Thesis or Dissertation:\n        \nDissertation: The dissertation must demonstrate an independent research competence on the part of the candidate that substantially adds to knowledge in the candidate's field with respect either to its intellectual substance or professional practice. The dissertation should be of such standard as to warrant publication in peer reviewed journals or scholarly books or monographs or equivalent.\nMaster's Thesis: The Master's thesis should integrate relevant scholarship and demonstrate research competence, including the potential to add to knowledge in the student's field with respect to either its intellectual substance or professional practice.\nMFA Thesis: The MFA thesis project must demonstrate aesthetic and technical competence that integrates coursework and demonstrates an intellectual synthesis of the work in context. The MFA thesis project, as the culminating project of a terminal degree, should be of such standard as to warrant individual exhibition, festival screening, or the equivalent.\n\n\nDissertation Proposal: Content: The Dissertation Proposal should be prepared by the student in consultation with the student's Supervising Committee. The proposal should include:\n        \nA tentative title of the dissertation describing the topic as accurately and briefly as possible.\nThe background of the research, the hypotheses to be tested or concepts to be explored, and the methodology to be employed. It should also address the relationship of the proposed work to existing work in the field, at UT Dallas or elsewhere, its intended outcome, and its contribution to the field.\nA schedule of the remaining research activities, including major completion milestones.\nA set of up to five \"key words\" to assist in establishing the Data Base on Theses and Dissertations.\n\n\nDissertation Proposal: Approval: The proposal should be prepared by the student in consultation with the student's Supervising Professor, who will approve the document before its submission to the appropriate committee or administrator for that Department or Program. After its approval at the Department, Program, School, or Interdisciplinary Degree Committee level, the proposal will then be forwarded to the Dean of Graduate Education, together with the Department's or Program's nominations for Supervising Professor and members of the Supervising Committee and the anticipated time of completion. To allow the Supervising Committee the opportunity to guide the development of the project, the Dissertation Proposal must be approved in a semester prior to the one in which the Final Oral Examination will be held.\nSupervising Committee: General: The recommended Supervising Committee for the student is submitted by the appropriate committee or administrator for that Department or Program to the Dean of Graduate Education for approval. Subsequent changes in membership must also be subject to approval by the appropriate committee or administrator for that Department or Program, and in, turn the Dean of Graduate Education. Individuals qualified for service on the Supervising Committee will be voting members of the General Faculty (as defined by The University of Texas at Dallas Handbook of Operating Procedures), Adjunct Faculty, Clinical Faculty, Professors of Instruction, Professors of Practice, Distinguished Scholars in Residence, Emeritus Faculty, Research Professors, Research Scientists, Senior Lecturers, or Visiting Faculty who hold the highest earned degree in the field or fields concerned or exhibit an equivalent record of accomplishment. In addition to the Master's and doctoral degree membership composition as defined in sections 4 and 5 below, additional members outside the General Faculty may serve with the special approval of the Dean of Graduate Education. Members of the Supervising Committee will also be members of the Examining Committee. (*In the case of Adjunct Faculty, a General Faculty member will be appointed to co-chair the Supervising Committee).\nSupervising Committee: Master's Degree with Thesis: Appointment of a Master's thesis Supervising Committee consisting of at least three members is a function of the degree program expected to confer the student's degree. Additional members may be appointed. All appointments must be approved by the Dean of Graduate Education. The appropriate committee or administrator of the program in consultation with the student, will nominate:\n        \nthe Chair, who serves as the supervisor of the research, will ordinarily be a voting member of the General Faculty holding the rank of Professor, Associate Professor, or Assistant Professor. Adjunct Faculty, Clinical Faculty, Professors of Instruction, Professors of Practice, Distinguished Scholars in Residence, Emeritus Faculty, Research Professors, Research Scientists, Senior Lecturers, or Visiting Faculty who hold the highest earned degree or exhibit an equivalent record of accomplishment in the field or fields of the research or aesthetics may be appointed as Chair if he/she receives a 2/3 majority recommendation of the Professors of the academic discipline and approval of the Academic Dean of the School offering the degree.\nat least two voting members of the General Faculty from the graduate degree program expected to confer the student's degree; and\nif necessary, a third representative appointed by the appropriate committee or administrator for that discipline.\nAny school varying from the above procedures in constituting Supervising Committees must have had prior approval from the Dean of Graduate Education.\n      \nSupervising Committee: Doctoral Degree: Appointment of a Doctoral dissertation Supervising Committee consisting of at least four members is a function of the degree program expected to confer the student's degree. Additional members may be appointed. All appointments must be approved by the Dean of Graduate Education. The appropriate committee or administrator of the program, in consultation with the student, will nominate:\n        \nthe Chair, who serves as the supervisor of the research, will ordinarily be a voting member of the General Faculty holding the rank of Professor, Associate Professor, or Assistant Professor in the studen't academic discipline. Adjunct Faculty, Clinical Faculty, Professors of Instruction, Professors of Practice, Distinguished Scholars in Residence, Emeritus Faculty, Research Professors, Research Scientists, Senior Lecturers, or Visiting Faculty who hold the highest earned degree or exhibit an equivalent record of accomplishment in the field or fields of the research or aesthetics may be appointed as Chair if he/she receives a 2/3 majority recommendation of the Professors of the academic discipline and approval of the Academic Dean of the School offering the degree.\nnot less than three voting members of the General Faculty from the academic discipline(s) related to the doctoral research that will be conducted by the student; and\nif necessary, a fourth representative appointed by the appropriate committee or administrator for that discipline.\nSchools varying from the above procedures in constituting Supervising Committees must have had prior approval from the Dean of Graduate Education.\n      \n\n\nSUPERVISION: The Supervising Committee will meet with the candidate soon after the Dean of Graduate Education has approved membership of the Committee. The intention of this initial meeting should be to discuss potential problem areas in the proposal and to establish a procedure that the Committee wishes to adopt to follow the research to a successful conclusion, e.g., the frequency and format of contact between candidate and Committee. The Supervising Committee must meet at least once annually, assess the student's progress, and send a report on that progress to the appropriate committee or administrator for that program and to the Dean of Graduate Education. This report should describe any problems which have the potential to delay the research beyond its anticipated completion date. A copy of this report must also be sent to the student. The student can request a meeting of the Supervising Committee through a written request to the appropriate committee or administrator for that program. The appropriate committee or administrator for that program will be responsible for convening such a meeting, generally within two weeks of the student's request, unless this timing is impossible owing to the absence of the Supervising Professor. No more than one student-initiated meeting can be called within an academic year. Provision for coverage of leaves of absence of either students or committee members will have been discussed at the initial meeting of the Supervising Committee. Any arrangements for surrogate supervision or changes in the student's plans will be communicated to the appropriate committee or administrator for that program, in writing, with a copy to the Dean of Graduate Education. Because of the relationship between the student and the Supervising Committee, committee members on leave of absence or who have left their positions with the university may be given permission to remain on the committee by the Dean of Graduate Education. However, they must agree to be active participants in supervisory activities and to be present for the final examination. If this is not possible, the committee member must be replaced and a new member of the General Faculty must be submitted for approval.\n    \nManuscript Preparation: Style and format requirements have been established for theses and dissertations prepared at UT Dallas. Prior to submitting manuscripts, candidates should consult the Dissertation and Thesis Formatting Guide which can be obtained from http://www.utdallas.edu/dept/graddean/dgIndex.htm.\n      \nCommittee Approval of the Manuscript: Approval of the thesis or dissertation to go forward for examination can only be given after the members have considered the entire manuscript. Members of the committee who do NOT agree that the manuscript is examinable, whether in the majority or not, should inform the Department Head or program administrator immediately, and in writing, so that such objections may be discussed with the Supervising Professor and the candidate.\nIndependent Research Competence: The dissertation must demonstrate an independent research competence on the part of the candidate that substantially adds to knowledge in the candidate's field with respect either to its intellectual substance or professional practice. The dissertation should be of such standard as to warrant publication in peer reviewed journals or scholarly books or monographs or equivalent.\nSubmission of the Final Draft of the Thesis or Dissertation: Once the candidate has, in the judgment of the Supervising Professor, prepared an examinable thesis/dissertation manuscript, it should be distributed to the other members of the Supervising Committee, allowing them a minimum of two weeks to review the document. After reading the document, a majority of the Supervising Committee members must agree that the document is ready to be defended before a request for a Final Oral Examination may be submitted and an examination date scheduled. The Final Oral Examination must be scheduled in at least one semester after the semester in which the Dissertation Proposal was approved. Committee members should ensure that the manuscript is complete, has been rigorously proofread (preferably by a professional proofreader), and meets scholarship standards for theses or dissertations. The student then submits a copy of the dissertation and the Request for Final Oral Examination form, signed with no more than one dissenting vote by the Supervising Committee members to the Office of the Dean of Graduate Education, which shall approve the scheduling of the Final Oral Examination. Members of the committee who do NOT agree that the manuscript is examinable should inform the appropriate committee or administrator for that program immediately, and in writing, so that such objections may be discussed with the Supervising Professor and the candidate. The Final Oral Examination cannot be scheduled until a resolution has been reached with, at most, one dissenting vote.\nSubmission of Final Approved Thesis or Dissertation: Students must submit a final approved, electronic version of their dissertation/thesis to the Office of Graduate Education. An electronic version of the dissertation/thesis will be held by the library and available to the public. An electronic copy may also be submitted to UMI/ProQuest who will make it publicly available in hard copy and on the web. Information about required format and the submission process can be found at https://graduate.utdallas.edu/current_students/dissertation_and_thesis/.\n      \n\n\nFINAL ORAL EXAMINATION\n    \nExamining Committee: The Dean of Graduate Education, will appoint the Examining Committee. The membership of the Examining Committee will include all members of the Supervisory Committee plus a non-voting representative appointed by the Dean of Graduate Education. The representative serves as the Chair of the Examining Committee. An examiner external to the University may also be appointed by the Dean of Graduate Education on the recommendation of a member of the Supervising Committee or the candidate.\nConducting the Examination: Formal arrangements, such as time and place for the Final Oral Examination, are made by the appropriate committee or administrator for that program, in consultation with the candidate and the Examining Committee, and with the approval of the Dean of Graduate Education. The examination will be conducted by the Chair of the Dissertation Committee in a manner appropriate to the material presented, and in accordance with current University regulations. The discussion will primarily focus on the candidate's research, although aspects of the general field in which it was conducted may also be covered\nAttendance Requirements for the Final Oral Examination: \n          \nFinal Oral Examinations may be either held in person or remotely.\nFor in person examinations the doctoral candidate and all members of the Examining Committee must be physically present on campus for the examination to be valid. If one member of the dissertation committee (aside from the chair) cannot attend in person, a written petition for exemption may be submitted to the Dean of Graduate Education. If a member of the Examining Committee is absent without a written exemption from the Dean of Graduate Education, or if more than one member of the Examining Committee is absent, then the Chair of the Examining Committee shall not hold the defense. The defense shall be rescheduled in consultation with the candidate and the Examining Committee, and with the approval of the Dean of Graduate Education.\nFor remote examinations, the doctoral candidate and all members of the Examining Committee must attend online. If one member of the dissertation committee (aside from the chair) will be absent from the defense, a written petition for exemption may be submitted to the Dean of Graduate Education. If a member of the Examining Committee is absent without a written exemption from the Dean of Graduate Education, or if more than one member of the Examining Committee is absent, then the Chair of the Examining Committee shall not hold the defense. The defense shall be rescheduled in consultation with the candidate and the Examining Committee, and with the approval of the Dean of Graduate Education.\n\nAny examination varying from the above requirements must have had prior approval from the Dean of Graduate Education.\nThe final oral examination shall be conducted in three phases.\n        \nPhase I. The candidate will make a formal public presentation of the research at the UT Dallas campus. That presentation is open to the public, and members of the audience may ask questions. The Supervising Professor will chair this phase and supervise the questioning.\nPhase II. Following the public presentation, the candidate will be examined by the members of the Examining Committee. This part of the examination is not open to the public. Depending upon the school\u2019s policy, other members of the faculty may also attend that part of the examination. This portion of the examination will be chaired by the representative of the Dean of Graduate Education. Video, and/or audio recording is prohibited during this phase of the examination, whether conducted in person or remotely.\nPhase III. After the completion of the oral examination, the Examining Committee will vote on the results of the Final Oral Examination The committee will reach agreement on one of the five possible outcomes listed below with no more than one dissenting vote. If the committee cannot reach agreement on one of the options, then the candidate will have failed the oral examination and the manuscript will not be accepted. Video, and/or audio recording is prohibited during this phase of the examination, whether conducted in person or remotely.\n            \nPassed the oral examination and manuscript accepted,\nPassed the oral examination and manuscript accepted pending specified revisions,\nSecond oral examination required, but manuscript accepted or accepted with specified revisions,\nMajor revisions of the manuscript and a second final oral examination required,\nOral examination failed, manuscript not accepted and the committee recommends dismissal from the program.: Following the vote of the Examining Committee, the Dean's representative shall complete the Examination Report, to be forwarded to the Dean of Graduate Education.\n\n\n\n\nProcedures concerning Acceptance, Specified and Major revisions, and Failure are as follows:\n        \nAccepted - The committee agrees that the dissertation is acceptable either without any revisions, or with minor revisions such as corrections of typographical errors or changes of a minor editorial nature. It is the Supervising Professor's responsibility to ensure that such corrections are made. The final corrected and approved copies of the dissertation must be submitted to the Office of the Dean of Graduate Education within the same semester. If the final approved copy is not submitted within the semester, the results of the examination will be changed to Accepted Pending Specified Revisions and will be dealt with as specified under that result.\nAccepted Pending Specified Revisions - The Committee agrees that the dissertation is acceptable pending changes, which may include insertions or deletions. Such changes would be of the kind which do not radically modify the development/argument of the dissertation but which go beyond minor revisions. The practical criterion will be that the committee is able to specify such changes with precision. It is the responsibility of the Supervising committee to certify that all such changes have been made. If the final approved copy is not submitted by the end of the semester following the examination, the results of the examination will be changed to Referred Pending Major Revisions and will be dealt with as specified under that result.\nReferred Pending Major Revisions - The Committee agrees that the dissertation requires substantive changes in order for the dissertation to be acceptable. Detailed reasons for this decision must be supplied by the Chair of the Examining committee to the Dean of Graduate Education, the appropriate committee or administrator for that program, and the candidate concerned. These recommendations on required changes must be approved by all members of the Committee. The committee reconvenes within a period not to exceed twelve months to conduct a second Final Oral Examination. This second attempt on the Final Oral Examination will be the final attempt by the student. If the Final Oral Examination and the written manuscript are not graded within the Accepted category, the student is dismissed from the program.\nFailure - If the majority of the Examining Committee votes for failure of the oral and the non-acceptance of the manuscript, the student will be dismissed from the program. In no case will a third oral be given.\n\n\nRegistration During Manuscript Revision: Regardless of the revisions to be made, the student will be required to register for three credit hours and pay fees until the revisions are accepted by the Office of the Dean of Graduate Education.\nImpact of revisions upon time limit for degree completion: The ten-year time limit for completion of the degree is still in effect while these revisions are being completed.\nPublication of dissertations and theses: Public availability of a dissertation or thesis may, upon request to the Dean of Graduate Education, be delayed for up to 2 years to allow time for publication in scholarly journals, books, or equivalent, or to meet academic publisher restrictions, or because of patent related activities.\n\n\nREGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS\n    \nExaminations or Proposal Presentation: A student must be registered for at least three semester credit hours of graduate course work during the semester in which any major degree examination, such as the Qualifying Examination or comprehensive exam is taken, or during the semester in which the proposal is submitted for approval.\nProcedures are outlined in the Graduate Catalog - Continuous Enrollment for Thesis or Dissertation: Once a student has enrolled in thesis or dissertation unless a leave of absence has been granted, that student must maintain continuous enrollment (not necessarily for thesis or dissertation) of at least three semester hours during consecutive long semesters until the final approved copy of the manuscript has been submitted to Office of the Dean of Graduate Education.\nEnrollment During the Semester of Graduation: Doctoral students must be enrolled in at least 1 credit hour in the semester in which they graduate, unless they have submitted a final approved dissertation/thesis to the Office of the Dean of Graduate Education before the priority deadline published by the Office of Graduate Education, for that semester. Students who do not meet the priority deadline must enroll in at least 1 semester credit hour in the second 8-week session of that semester. Enrollment for 1 semester credit hour in the final semester is only allowed once. However, the individual degree program may require more than 1 credit hour be taken during the graduation semester.\n\n\nTIME LIMITS: All requirements for a graduate degree, including transfer of credit must be completed within the specified time period. Students exceeding the specified time limit will not be eligible for their degree and will be dismissed from that graduate program. An approved leave of absence will not alter the time limits placed on graduate degrees.\n    \nMaster's Degree: All requirements for the Master's degree must be completed within one six-year period. Work over six years old, whether done at this University or elsewhere, will not count towards the Master's degree except through the petition process described in the \"Time Limit: Exceptions\" section.\nDoctoral Degree: All requirements for the Doctoral degree must be completed within one ten-year period. Work over ten years old, whether done at this University or elsewhere, will not count towards the Doctoral degree except through the petition process described in the \"Time Limit: Exceptions\" section. Students whose master's degrees are accepted for full credit toward a Ph.D. must complete all requirements for the doctoral degree within one eight-year period. Work exceeding these limits, whether done at this university or elsewhere, will not count towards the degree.\nExceptions \u2014 Course Work: The time limits affecting course work taken early in a graduate program can be waived only when a student can demonstrate to the appropriate committee or administrator for that program that:\n        \nthe substantive material in the course is still relevant to the curriculum and,\nthe student still retains a substantial grasp of the material taught in the course.\nIn such case, the acceptability of the course work in the student's Program of Studies must be approved by the Dean of Graduate Education upon the recommendation of the appropriate committee or administrator for that program.\n      \nExceptions \u2014 Research: The time limits can be waived only for research extending beyond the prescribed limits and only in exceptional cases where the student, Supervising Professor, and the appropriate committee or administrator for that program can demonstrate that:\n        \nsubstantial progress has been made in the research effort and the student can successfully complete the thesis or dissertation within a two term extension, including the summer term, and\na schedule to complete the research has been developed including major milestones of accomplishments. In such a case, the acceptability of the plan to finish the research must be approved by the Dean of Graduate Education upon the recommendation of the appropriate committee or administrator for that program.\n\n\nProcedures Prior to Graduation: An Application for Graduation must be filed during the semester of graduation on or before the date stipulated in the Academic Calendar.\n\n\n\n\n Policy HistoryRevised: 1990-05-15Revised: 1992-03-01Revised: 1992-11-01Revised: 1997-06-24Editorial Amendments: 1998-02-02Editorial Amendments: 2000-09-01Revised: 2000-12-15Revised: 2006-12-13Revised: 2008-12-02Revised: 2010-12-17Revised: 2013-09-13Revised: 2016-06-09Editorial Amendments: 2016-11-11Revised: 2017-03-09Revised: 2017-07-05Revised: 2018-05-31Editorial Amendments: 2018-12-05Revised: 2019-04-02Revised: 2019-08-01Revised: 2019-10-10Revised: 2020-11-16Revised: 2021-03-24Revised: 2021-12-14Revised: 2022-03-07 \nPolicy Links\n\nPermalink for this policy: https://policy.utdallas.edu/utdpp1052\nLink to PDF version: https://policy.utdallas.edu/utdpp1052/makepdf\nLink to printable version: https://policy.utdallas.edu/utdpp1052/makeprint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy Navigator\n\n\nSearch Policies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe University of Texas at DallasUT Dallas ProvostCourseBookContact the Provost's Technology Group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

You\u2019ve likely seen them all around\n campus delivering food, drinks, and even snacks to fellow\u00a0Comets!\nUT Dallas Dining (Chartwells) partnered with Starship Technologies\n to bring 30\u00a0robots to campus for the initial launch on December\u00a03\u00a02019.\n Starship is revolutionizing deliveries with autonomous robots. The robots have traveled\n thousands of miles across 100\u00a0cities around the world and we are so excited to help\n our partner bring this exciting new convenience to the campus\u00a0community.\nA few notes about the program and the robots\u00a0themselves:\n\nStarship was founded by two Skype co-founders, Ahti Heinla and Janus\u00a0Friis.\nTo use the service, students, staff and faculty can download the Starship Deliveries app from either the Apple\u00ae (iOS) or Google Play (Android\u2122) app stores.\nThere are 10\u00a0dining locations to start with: Papa John\u2019s,\n     Panda Express, Smash\u2019d, Firehouse Subs, Halal Shack, Einstein Bros. Bagels,\n     The Pub, The Market\n    SU [Student Union]  and The Market\n    DHW [Dining Hall West] .\nThere will be additional retail venues available on the app in the\u00a0future.\nDelivery hours vary by participating venues, opening the app you will see what\n     venues are open and available for deliveries at that\u00a0time.\nThe Starship Deliveries app will accept debit/credit\n     transactions. We plan to accept Meal Money as tender in the\u00a0future.\nUsers select their delivery location by dropping a pin on the map inside the\u00a0app.\nOnce an order is placed, the app will update the user of the robot\u2019s\n     location in real\u00a0time.\nOnce the robot arrives to the spot the user has selected the app will send\n     an alert that the robot has\u00a0arrived.\nThe robot will meet you outside of your building, be sure and bring your\n     cell phone to unlock the robot through the\u00a0app.\nThe robots drive autonomously but are monitored by humans who can take control\n     at any\u00a0time.\nYou may sometimes hear the robot verbally greet you and or thank\u00a0you.\nThe robots can carry up to 20\u00a0pounds.\nThe robot can travel up to about 4\u00a0mph.\nThere is a $1.99 delivery\u00a0fee.\nRobots can deliver to Northside, SPN and\u00a0SPN2.\nIf you have any issues with an order, select the HELP section\n     within the Starship Deliveries app and they will go\n     to work to fix the\u00a0issue.\n\nIf you have any additional questions, feel free to send an email message to foodservice@utdallas.edu.\n\n\n\n\nDining Services\u00a0\n\nDining Locations >\nMenus >\nMeal Plans >\nDelivery\nVending Services\nOn-Campus Catering\n\nBook & Tech Store >\u00a0\n\nBook & Tech Store FAQ\n\nMail Services\u00a0\n\nBulk Mail\nMail Stops\nTrack Packages\nExport Controlled or Embargoed Countries\n\nParking & Transportation\n\nAccessible Services\nParking\nParking Garages\nParking FAQ\nComet Cruiser\nComet Cab\nDART\nZipcar\nBooster Fuels\nBicycles\nTollTags\nSkates, Rollerblades, &\u00a0Skateboards\nSpecial Events\n\nPrint & Copy Services\nInventory\u00a0\nTraining\u00a0\nNews\u00a0\nTools\u00a0\nDocuments\u00a0\nContact Us\u00a0\nSearch\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n"

If you have a mobility accommodation need,\r\n please review our Accessible Cart Service\u00a0option.\n\n\n\nYou can wave down a Comet Cab at any safe point along its route\n that doesn\u2019t obstruct traffic\n \u2014such as a crosswalk or stop sign\u2014 and be dropped off at any safe point on its circuit.\n Because of this, Comet Cabs don\u2019t keep a regular schedule like the Comet Cruiser (DART [Dallas Area Rapid Transit]  Route 883).\n Each route has its own hours of operation, which can change at different times of the year,\n sometimes running shorter during Summer Semester and when classes aren\u2019t in\u00a0session.\nFor more information, please contact us at transit@utdallas.edu / 972.883.7777.\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat are Comet Cabs?\n\nComet Cabs are our inner-campus shuttle service. They are free to ride and offer a quick\n trip to different areas of\u00a0campus.\n\n\nHow can I catch a Comet Cab?\n\nYou can wave down a Comet Cab at any safe point along its path that doesn\u2019t\n obstruct traffic, like at a crosswalk or stop sign, and be dropped off at any safe point\n on its route. The primary boarding locations are located at the start and end of each route.\n Be sure to always wait until the Comet Cabs are at a complete stop before boarding or\n exiting the vehicle, and alert your driver before exiting the\u00a0vehicle.\n\n\nWhere do Comet Cabs go?\n\nComet Cabs travel all over campus, but they have to stay on their designated route\n and can\u2019t go off course. Comet Cabs cannot travel on public streets or pedestrian\n areas, and are limited to campus roadways and parking lots only. There are currently\n six Comet Cab routes. Review our \nroute map (PDF [Portable Document Format File] ) for more\u00a0information.\n\n\nWhen do the Comet Cabs run?\n\nComet Cabs have a daily operating schedule, but do not follow a set schedule for each\n stop. Each \nroute (PDF [Portable Document Format File] ) has its own hours of operation, which can change at different times of the year,\n sometimes running less during the summer semesters, or when classes aren\u2019t\n in session. Be sure to check our website and follow our Twitter page for schedule\u00a0changes.\nGenerally, the routes run as\u00a0follows-\n\nUniversity Commons\nMonday-Thursday 7-45\u00a0a.m. - 10-00\u00a0p.m.\nFriday 7-45\u00a0a.m. - 7-00\u00a0p.m.\nRutford North\nMonday-Friday 9-00\u00a0a.m. - 7-00\u00a0p.m.\nRutford South\nMonday-Friday 9-00\u00a0a.m. - 7-00\u00a0p.m.\nUniversity Village\n1-3 Monday-Thursday 9-00\u00a0a.m. - 7-00\u00a0p.m.\nUniversity Village\n4-7 Monday-Friday 9-00\u00a0a.m. - 7-00\u00a0p.m.\nCanyon Creek Heights\nMonday-Thursday 7-45\u00a0a.m. - 10-00\u00a0p.m.\nFriday 7-45\u00a0a.m. - 7-00\u00a0p.m.\n\n\n\nAre all golf carts \u201cComet Cabs\u201d?\n\nNo, several departments on campus utilize golf carts for other purposes. Comet Cabs\n can be identified by their route sign designation in the front windshield, and by the\n drivers wearing \u201cPARKING & TRANSPORTATION\u201d safety\u00a0vests.\n\n\nWhat if I need service to a location not along one of the current routes?\n\nAccessible Cart Service is available for students that have accessibility accommodations\n with the Office of Student AccessAbility. Service is\n also available for faculty and staff if their have accommodations with the Office of Human Resources, or hold a state-issued\n accessible parking placard or license plate. Services must be scheduled in advance to guarantee\n service. While custom routes can be designed for those needing accessible service,\n Comet Cabs are unable to travel on public streets or pedestrian areas, and are limited\n to campus roadways and parking lots\u00a0only.\nRequest Accessible Cart\u00a0Service\nFor those hosting special events on campus, Comet Cabs are available for rental.\n Please review our Special Events page for more\u00a0information.\n\n\nHow many passengers can be seated on the Comet Cabs?\n\nThe majority of our Comet Cabs hold five passengers. We also have a limited number\n of larger Comet Cabs that hold up to twelve passengers, which are typically reserved\n for special events, or high ridership\u00a0routes.\n\n\nWhy don\u2019t I always see a Comet Cab in my area?\n\nDuring certain times such as a shift change, or when a Comet Cab needs gas or other\n maintenance, we may be out of service for short periods of time. Additionally, the\n Comet Cabs cannot operate in inclement weather, or when the University is closed.\n Please check our GPS Service to see where Comet Cabs are\n currently on route, and follow our Twitter page for\u00a0updates.\n\n\nCan I take a Comet Cab every day, or are there limits to the service?\n\nYou may ride a Comet Cab whenever a seat is available on the cart. Note that during\n peak operating hours, seating can be limited so do not rely on the Comet Cabs to be on\n time to class! They are offered as a convenience to the campus community and are\n not a formal transportation\u00a0system.\nBe sure to verify that the cart you want to board is the correct \nroute (PDF [Portable Document Format File] ) for where you would like to go, that the driver is on duty, and that the cart is not\n reserved for a special event or those with accessibility accommodations (indicated\n by signage in the\u00a0windshield).\nWe ask that riders do not continuously ride the Comet Cabs with no destination.\n Be sure to board and exit the vehicle at your desired locations so we can continue\n to serve others on the\u00a0campus.\n\n\n\nComet Cab Route Map and FAQ (PDF [Portable Document Format File] )\nFind Your Cab\u00a0>\nSpecial Event Shuttles\nAccessible Cart Service\nComet Cab on\u00a0Twitter\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDining Services\u00a0\n\nDining Locations >\nMenus >\nMeal Plans >\nDelivery\nVending Services\nOn-Campus Catering\n\nBook & Tech Store >\u00a0\n\nBook & Tech Store FAQ\n\nMail Services\u00a0\n\nBulk Mail\nMail Stops\nTrack Packages\nExport Controlled or Embargoed Countries\n\nParking & Transportation\n\nAccessible Services\nParking\nParking Garages\nParking FAQ\nComet Cruiser\nComet Cab\nDART\nZipcar\nBooster Fuels\nBicycles\nTollTags\nSkates, Rollerblades, &\u00a0Skateboards\nSpecial Events\n\nPrint & Copy Services\nInventory\u00a0\nTraining\u00a0\nNews\u00a0\nTools\u00a0\nDocuments\u00a0\nContact Us\u00a0\nSearch\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n"

Doesn\u2019t tuition or student fees cover this\u00a0cost?\n\nEvery student, faculty and staff member must purchase a permit to park on\n UT\u00a0Dallas property. UTD Parking & Transportation is\u00a0self-funded.\nStudent tuition and fees are not allotted for UTD\u2019s parking\u00a0budget.\nParking permit sales provide us with the necessary funds to build new parking\n structures, repave parking lots, improve services and provide general\u00a0maintenance.\n\n\nHas parking increased in cost this\u00a0year?\n\nNo, the University has elected not to increase the cost of parking permits, nor metered parking, for the FY21 [Fiscal Year 2021]  and FY22 [Fiscal Year 2022]  academic\u00a0years.\n\n\nIf I decide to return to campus at a later date, are parking permit prices prorated in\u00a0cost?\n\nAll parking permit purchases are valid from the date of purchase through August\u00a031\n of the current academic year. Parking permits are prorated in cost throughout the academic\n year. For students, parking permits are prorated in December and in May to reflect Spring\n and Summer prices. For employees, permits are prorated on the first of each\u00a0month.\n\n\nIf I purchase a parking permit now, can I upgrade or downgrade my permit in the\u00a0future?\n\nYes, you may upgrade or downgrade your permit at any time. Upgrades require a one-time additional payment equal to the difference in value between your current and your new permit. Downgrades may be entitled to a refund, depending on your original purchase method. Please contact us for options specific to your account and permit\u00a0type.\n\n\nI am a student living on campus. Can I park more than one vehicle on campus this\u00a0year?\n\nNo, Apartment and Residence Hall permits are limited to only one permit per resident to ensure parking availability for all students living on\u00a0campus.\n\n\nI am a commuter student, but I am taking classes mostly online. Do I still need to purchase a parking\u00a0permit?\n\nWhen on campus, you must be legally parked at all times to avoid parking citations. When parking on campus, you may either utilize the hourly pay-by-space metered parking spaces, or purchase an annual parking\u00a0permit.\n\n\nHow many parking garages are there? Where is PS2? Do I need a separate permit to use the parking\u00a0garages?\n\nThere are currently three parking structures. PS1 on the east side\n of campus, PS3 on the north side of campus and PS4\n on the west side of\u00a0campus.\nPS2 is not built or available at this time. PS2\n is currently still in the planning stage and was not elected to be built at the time\n of design and construction began on PS3\u00a0instead.\nParking structures can be used by any commuter parking permit and no special garage\n permit is required. Residential permits are not valid in the parking\u00a0garages.\n\n\nWhat if I need to park close to a building to drop off or unload a\u00a0vehicle?\n\nLoading zones are available throughout campus. Loading zones may be used without\n a parking permit for up to 20 minutes as long as you have your emergency flashers\n engaged on your vehicle. Please do not block roads, reserves spaces, crosswalks,\n etc. when loading and\u00a0unloading.\nDownload a Map of Campus Loading Zones (PDF [Portable Document Format File] )\n\n\nWhere is the free\u00a0parking?\n\nThere is no free parking on the UT Dallas campus for students, faculty or\u00a0staff.\nFor those wishing to use public transportation, there are nearly 2,000 free parking\n spaces available at the Cityline/Bush Train\u00a0Station\n Park-and-Ride at 1300 E President George Bush Tpke, Richardson, TX 75082.\n From there, users may ride the Comet Cruiser bus line to campus, free of charge and with\n no transit pass nor UTD\u00a0ID required to\u00a0ride.\nVisitors to the campus may obtain a complimentary one-day visitor pass, valid in \nVisitor or Green spaces,\n by presenting a valid photo ID at the Visitor Center (VCB) or at our office. Visitors may receive two free permits per\u00a0week.\nWe also have Pay-by-Space credit/debit parking meters available\n in popular areas such as Lot\u00a0M-West, Lot\u00a0G, \nLot\u00a0F and on the first level of each parking\u00a0structure.\n\n\nHow does Visitor parking\u00a0work?\n\nVisitors to the campus may obtain a complimentary one-day visitor pass from\n the Visitor Center (VCB) or at our office. A current driver\u2019s license\n must be presented to obtain a visitor\u00a0pass.\nVisitors may receive two complimentary parking passes per week. This will allow\n visitors to park in any Green space for the date\n of issuance\u00a0only.\nVisitor permits for the University Commons Residence Halls, University Village Apartments\n or Canyon Creek Heights Apartments may also be obtained by request. To obtain a visitor\n permit for a housing guest, both the guest and the resident need to come to the Parking Office with valid photo IDs and the guest\u2019s\n license plate information. A housing guest may receive up to two visitor passes per week\n and two overnight parking passes per\u00a0month.\nLong-term visitor permits (more than two weekdays) can be purchased at\n prorated rates from our office. Please note that overnight visitors to\n on-campus housing are limited to two nights per month, unless written permission\n is obtained from the student\u2019s housing\u00a0office.\nFor more convenient parking, we also have Pay-by-Space credit/debit parking meters available\n in popular areas such as Lot\u00a0M-West, Lot\u00a0G, \nLot\u00a0F and on the first level of each parking\u00a0structure.\n\n\nHow do I know if there are any parking lot or garage\u00a0closures?\n\nWe have an active Twitter account, @UTDallasParking, that regularly updates any\n information on parking or garage closures. We also have Twitter accounts\n for the Comet Cabs (@UTDCometCab) and the Comet Cruisers (@UTDCometCruiser) where we provide updates\n on new routes, schedule delays, or route detours or\u00a0cancellations.\n\nPermits\n\nHow can I purchase a parking\u00a0permit?\n\nTo purchase a parking permit, you will need to provide your vehicle license plate\nstate and number, vehicle make, model, color, and\u00a0year.\nPermits can be purchased online.\nYou may also purchase your permit in person at our office. If you will be coming to our office,\n a valid state-issued photo ID, driver\u2019s license or student ID must be\u00a0presented.\nIf you purchase your permit in-person at our office, please be advised that we do not\n accept cash or checks. We only accept debit and credit\u00a0cards.\nPermits are required for all vehicles to park on UT\u00a0Dallas owned or leased property\n regardless of whether you are an online student, part-time student, full-time student,\n faculty, staff or\u00a0visitor.\n\n\nWhat about accessible\u00a0parking?\n\nA UT\u00a0Dallas Accessible Parking Permit,\n in addition to a state-issued accessible parking placard or license plate,\n is required to park in accessible parking spaces on\u00a0campus.\nPlease see our  Accessible Services page for more\u00a0information.\n\n\nWhy do we have different parking\u00a0permits?\n\nParking designates different lots based on whether students live on campus\n or commute to\u00a0campus.\nResidential parking is separated between the University Commons Residence Halls,\n University Village Apartments and Canyon Creek Heights Apartments. Apartment and Residence Hall\n permits are only valid in their specific lots, as well as Green\n parking in certain remote parking areas.\nWhere You Can Use Residential Parking Permits\u00a0>\nHousing students may also purchase a commuter Gold\n or Orange permit if they choose, but they may not\n park overnight on the main campus and must return to their on-campus housing parking lot at the end of the\u00a0day.\nFor commuters, faculty, and staff, parking is on a progressing scale system\n with Purple being the highest\n and Green being the lowest.\n\nPurple permits can park in\n    \nPurple parking\nOrange parking\nGold parking\nGreen parking\n\nOrange permits can park in\n    \nOrange parking\nGold parking\nGreen parking\n\nGold permits can park in\n    \nGold parking\nGreen parking\n\nGreen permits can only park\n     in\u00a0Green parking\n\nCommuter students may purchase Green, \nGold, Evening Orange\n or Orange parking permits. \nEvening Orange allows you to park in \nOrange spaces after 5:00\u00a0p.m. Before\n 5:00\u00a0p.m., Evening Orange permits may park in only \nGold and Green\u00a0spaces.\nStaff and Faculty have access to all commuter colors, but also have the option\n to purchase Purple\u00a0permits.\n\n\nCan I get a parking permit if I have unpaid\u00a0citations?\n\nYou may purchase a parking permit with unpaid citations, however outstanding citations may result in your account\n being revoked and your vehicle being immobilized or towed if parked on UT\u00a0Dallas owned or leased\n property. If your vehicle is immobilized, your parking privileges are revoked and you\n may need to pay your citations first before being able to purchase your parking\u00a0permit.\n\n\nWhat should I do if I have two vehicles? Do I get a second permit for\u00a0free?\n\nWe only issue one permit per customer. You may have up to five vehicles associated\n with your permit, but only one vehicle parked on campus at any given\u00a0time.\nYou may add a vehicle to your account online by selecting the VEHICLES tab. You may also contact\n the Parking Office via email or visit our office to add a vehicle to your account. If you\n would like a permit for each vehicle, you may purchase additional permits at the current\u00a0rate.\nPlease note that students living on campus may purchase one residential permit\n and one commuter permit for their vehicle, but they may have only one vehicle on\n campus at a\u00a0time.\n\n\nHow many vehicles can I have registered to my\u00a0account?\n\nYou may have an unlimited amount of vehicles attached to your customer account, but only\n a maximum of five vehicles per parking permit. Only one vehicle may be parked on campus\n at a time, and it must have a permit linked to it at all\u00a0times.\nVehicles parked on UT Dallas property must have a valid UT\u00a0Dallas parking permit\n linked to it at all times for the section where the vehicle is\u00a0parked.\n\n\nWhat should I do if my vehicle is being repaired? What should I do if I have a rental or temporary\u00a0vehicle?\n\nPeople who currently have an active parking permit have a few options for temporary\u00a0permits.\nPeople who are driving a different vehicle and currently have an active parking permit\n have the option to register their vehicle for the duration they will be driving\u00a0it.\nOnly five vehicles can be registered to a permit at any given time. To remove any vehicle,\n including rentals and temporary vehicles, you must contact the parking office with the\n  vehicle make, model, and license plate\u00a0number.\nAll vehicles registered to the permit owner will be the responsibility of the permit\n owner including all citations the vehicle receives while it is registered to the\n permit\u00a0owner.\nCurrent permit holders may also receive up to three one-day passes per semester.\n These one-day passes will be valid for the same color of spaces as your permit, and you\n may receive these by presenting a CometCard or driver\u2019s license at the Parking Office.\n\n\nCan I share my permit with someone else, or register other people\u2019s vehicles to my\u00a0permit?\n\nAll virtual permits are non-transferable and can only be used by the individual to whom\n it is assigned, and permits are attached only to the account holder. For customers who\n have separate permits but drive each other\u2019s vehicles, both vehicles must be registered\n on each account. You may register up to five (5) vehicles to your virtual permit;\n however, only one vehicle can be parked on campus at any given time. Parking more than one\n vehicle on campus at one time may lead to citations for surpassing the vehicle limit\n of your permit. Any citations issued to a vehicle will be the responsibility of the\n account\u00a0holder.\n\n\nI am a faculty/staff member and I want to get my permit on Payroll Deduction, how does it\u00a0work?\n\nEligible faculty and staff should monitor their email for directions and enrollment\n dates. If you are eligible for Payroll Deduction, you may purchase your permit online\n and select \u201cPayroll Deduction\u201d as your purchase method at the time of checkout.\n If you do not see the option for Payroll Deduction, but you believe you are eligible,\n please contact our office so we can confirm\u00a0eligibility.\n\n\nI am joining UT Dallas later in the year. Are prices reduced for those on campus less than a full\u00a0year?\n\nAll parking permit purchases are valid from the date of purchase through August\u00a031\n of the current academic year. Parking permits are prorated in cost throughout the academic\n year. For students, parking permits are prorated in December and in May to reflect Spring\n and Summer prices. For employees, permits are prorated on the first of each\u00a0month.\n\n\nI am leaving UT Dallas, or I no longer need my parking permit. Can I get a refund for my parking\u00a0permit?\n\nIf you are a student graduating in fall, or you no longer have a need your permit,\n you may return the permit for a prorated refund. Returns must be made by the Spring Census Day to be eligible for a refund. Returns after the\n Spring Census Day will not be approved for a\u00a0refund.\nIf you are a faculty or staff member that purchased your permit in full, you may be\n eligible for a prorated refund when you leave UT Dallas. Permits purchased via Payroll\n Deduction are not eligible for refunds, but monthly deductions can be canceled by\n canceling your permit with our\u00a0office.\nYou can return your permit by contacting park@.utdallas.edu\n and requesting a permit return\u00a0form.\n\nOffice Information and Visitor Passes\n\nWhat are your office\u00a0hours?\n\nCurrent Office Hours\u00a0>\n\n\nMy family is coming to visit me at my residence, what do I need to\u00a0do?\n\nIf you are resident living in University Village Apartments, \nCanyon Creek Heights Apartments, or \nUniversity Commons Residence Halls and you need\n to arrange parking for a guest visiting your residence, permits can also be requested\n online in advance and emailed to you as a \nPDF [Portable Document File Format] \n document that you may email to your guest to be printed. To request an emailed permit,\n complete a permit request form online two business days in advance\n of the guest arrival. A visitor parking pass is required Monday-Thursday from\n 9:00\u00a0a.m. - 9:00\u00a0p.m. and Friday from 9:00\u00a0a.m. -\n 5:00\u00a0p.m. in the housing parking\u00a0areas.\nNon-sponsored visitors to campus may utilize our metered parking available throughout different areas of our\n campus, or contact park@utdallas.edu\n for more\u00a0options.\nPlease contact the Parking Office\n for any questions or concerns about visitor\u00a0parking.\nPlease note that a visitor permit is not required for Green, \nUniversity Village Apartments, \nCanyon Creek Heights Apartments, or \nUniversity Commons Residence Halls parking areas\n outside of enforcement\u00a0hours:\n\nMonday-Thursday from 9:00\u00a0a.m. - 9:00\u00a0p.m.\nFriday from 9:00\u00a0a.m. - 5:00\u00a0p.m.\n\nA VISITOR PERMIT IS ALWAYS NEEDED DURING THE ABOVE TIMES TO AVOID PARKING\u00a0CITATIONS\n\n\nHow do I add or update a vehicle on my parking\u00a0account?\n\nYou may add a vehicle to your account online by selecting the VEHICLES tab. You may also contact\n the Parking Office via email or visit our office and let us know you want to add\n a vehicle to your\u00a0account.\nYou will need to know your vehicle\u2019s license plate state and number, make,\n model, color, and year of your vehicle to add it to your\u00a0account.\n\n\nHow do I remove a vehicle from my parking\u00a0account?\n\nContact the Parking & Transportation department via email and notify us\n of the vehicle that needs to be removed. We cannot remove vehicles in person\n nor over the\u00a0phone.\n\n\nWhere is the Parking Office\u00a0located?\n\nWe are located in Parking Structure 3, at the intersection\n of Rutford Ave and Loop Road NW on the North end of campus, East of the Residence\u00a0Halls.\nOur physical address is:\n800 N. Loop Rd, Richardson TX, 75080.\nOur mailing address is:\nThe University of Texas at Dallas\nParking & Transportation\n800 W Campbell Rd, PS3\u00a010\nRichardson, TX 75080-3021\n\nCitations\n\nWhy did I get a\u00a0citation?\n\nCheck the citation in the \u201cViolation\u201d section to see the reasoning.\n Some citations are warnings only and are used to inform you of a problem. If you feel\n you do not deserve the citation then you may submit an appeal online. We do not do any in-person\u00a0appeals.\nAny appeal not granted must be paid online or in person at our office. Please be advised, appeals must be\n submitted within 14 calendar days from the date the citation was issued. However,\n an appeal does not guarantee an automatic dismissal of the\u00a0citation.\n\n\nI parked legally but still got a citation. What can be done about\u00a0it?\n\nThere are various reasons why a citation can be issued. You may be parked in your\n permit\u2019s designated area, but could be breaking one of our parking rules or\u00a0policies.\nYou may appeal the citation online. Again, appeals do not\n guarantee an automatic dismissal of a\u00a0citation.\n\n\nWhat happens if I do not pay my parking citations? Can you put a hold on my student\u00a0account?\n\nAfter 14 days the citation will increase from overdue charges. In addition, the\n citation will have a recurring monthly late fee that is added until the balance is\n paid in\u00a0full.\nAccumulated or overdue parking citations will place a hold on student accounts,\n thus not allowing a student to receive transcripts or receive their diploma.\n Faculty and staff may be subject to other disciplinary\u00a0measures.\n\n\nI paid at the Bursar, so why is there still a hold/fee on my\u00a0account?\n\nBursar/EZPay payments are transferred to your Parking account the following\n business day, after which your hold will be removed. If your Parking account does not\n update within two business days, or you still have a parking hold even with a $0.00\n balance, please contact our office. If your Bursar student account and\n your Parking account do not match for any other reason, please contact our\u00a0office.\n\n\n\n\n\nDining Services\u00a0\n\nDining Locations >\nMenus >\nMeal Plans >\nDelivery\nVending Services\nOn-Campus Catering\n\nBook & Tech Store >\u00a0\n\nBook & Tech Store FAQ\n\nMail Services\u00a0\n\nBulk Mail\nMail Stops\nTrack Packages\nExport Controlled or Embargoed Countries\n\nParking & Transportation\n\nAccessible Services\nParking\nParking Garages\nParking FAQ\nComet Cruiser\nComet Cab\nDART\nZipcar\nBooster Fuels\nBicycles\nTollTags\nSkates, Rollerblades, &\u00a0Skateboards\nSpecial Events\n\nPrint & Copy Services\nInventory\u00a0\nTraining\u00a0\nNews\u00a0\nTools\u00a0\nDocuments\u00a0\nContact Us\u00a0\nSearch\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n"

This system\n utilizes License Plate Recognition\n (LPR [License Plate Recognition] )\n and will identify your vehicle by its license plate. This system removes the need\n for physical stickers and allows all permit holders to easily add and maintain vehicles\n on their\u00a0accounts.\nLicense Plate Recognition\n (LPR [License Plate Recognition] )\n is camera-based technology that quickly scans multiple vehicle license plates. This\n technology allows us to transition to virtual permits by allowing a vehicle\u2019s\n license plate to serve in place of a sticker or decal permit. LPR cameras can scan your\n license plate to check if you have appropriate parking permissions, which eliminates\n the need to place a physical permit on your windshield. LPR is a mobile system that uses\n vehicle-mounted cameras to scan license plates and verify virtual permits in all lots\n and garages on\u00a0campus.\nVirtual Permits will be beneficial to our campus as they eliminate the need to move\n your permit between multiple vehicles. They also support sustainability by reducing\n paper usage, ink, and plastic used for permit distribution and\u00a0postage.\nYou can register your vehicles to your Virtual Permit through the online Parking Portal.\n To register a vehicle online, log in to your MyParking account and select the vehicles tab. You will then\n be able to add a vehicle by entering the license plate and other vehicle details.\n You may register up to five (5) vehicles to your virtual permit; however, only one vehicle\n can be parked on campus at any given time. Parking more than one vehicle on campus at\n one time may lead to\u00a0citations.\nAll virtual permits are non-transferable and can only be used by the individual\n to whom it is assigned. For customers who have separate permits but drive each\n other\u2019s vehicles, both vehicles must be registered on each\u00a0account.\nIt is essential that all vehicle information is kept up-to-date to avoid receiving\n an unnecessary citation. Please log into your parking account to update your information\n immediately after any change to your license plate or vehicle. In the event that you\n drive a different vehicle to campus, you will also need to ensure that it is currently\n registered to your\u00a0permit.\nGeneral Parking Permit Information\nBuying a Permit\nParking permits are available to all current UT Dallas visitors, students, faculty, and staff.\n You can buy a permit in-person from the Parking Office or you can buy your permit online.  Students can purchase \nOrange, \nEvening Orange, \nGold, or \nGreen parking permits. On-campus residents who will have a vehicle\n on campus are required to purchase their respective housing permit. Housing students are\n allowed to purchase an additional \nOrange or \nGold permit for parking in commuter spaces\n on campus, but they can only park overnight in their respective residential lots. On-campus\n residents are only allowed to park one vehicle on campus at any given time, even if they\n have purchased two permits. Faculty and staff can purchase \nPurple, \nOrange, \nEvening Orange, \nGold, or \nGreen parking permits. \nAccessible parking permits are also available (see below). Please note, the Parking Office accepts credit\n and debit cards, but not cash or checks at this\u00a0time.\nA permit can be purchased as soon as a customer has access to their Parking Account. Commuter students, faculty, and staff may park in \nGreen parking without a permit from the first day of class until Census Day. This grace period only applies to the Fall and Spring\n semesters. The Summer semester requires a permit at all times. On-campus residents may\n park in their respective housing lot without a permit from the scheduled University Housing move-in dates until Census Day. With the exception of the Grace period for \nGreen and housing areas, all other parking areas\n will be enforced throughout the\u00a0year.\nYou must purchase a parking permit before the Spring or Fall Census Day to avoid citations.\nYou may register up to five (5) vehicles to your virtual permit; however,\n only one vehicle can be parked on campus at any given time. Parking more than one\n vehicle on campus at one time may lead to\u00a0citations.\nParking permits may not be purchased, transferred or obtained from any source or party\n other than the UT Dallas Parking and Transportation Office. Displaying or registering\n a parking permit that belongs to another customer is strictly prohibited and may lead\n to vehicle immobilization and additional fees and\u00a0penalties.\nIf you own a current parking permit for UT Arlington or UT Southwestern Medical Center students,\n faculty or staff, please bring in your receipt for that permit to the Parking Office to get a permit that will allow you\n to park in a comparable level based on your original purchase\u00a0price.\nReturning a Permit\n\nStudents\n\nIf you are a student who is graduating or leaving the University at the end of the\n Fall semester, you may request to cancel (deactivate) your parking permit\n privileges on or before the Spring Census Day for a prorated refund. If you are withdrawing\n from the University or decide you no longer need your permit, you may return the\n permit within 30\u00a0days from the date of purchase for a full\u00a0refund.\nTo upgrade your permit, you will have to pay the price difference between the permit\n you previously owned and the upgraded permit that you want to\u00a0buy.\nTo downgrade your permit, you will be refunded the difference between current value\n of the permit you previously owned and the downgraded permit that you want to\u00a0buy.\nStudents who move between \nUniversity Village Apartments, \nCanyon Creek Heights Apartments or\nUniversity Commons Residence Halls\n must request to exchange their current parking permit for the permit appropriate\n for their new residence; this exchange is free of charge. Students transitioning between\n commuter and on-campus resident must also request to exchange their permit. This permit\n will be assigned for a permit of equal value, free of\u00a0charge.\nYou can cancel, upgrade, downgrade or exchange your permit by contacting park@utdallas.edu\n and requesting a permit return\u00a0form.\n\n\nFaculty & Staff\n\nIf you are a faculty or staff member, you may request to cancel (deactivate)\n your parking permit privileges if you are exiting the University or decide you no longer\n need your permit. You may inquire about your eligibility for a prorated refund based on\n your original permit purchase method. Please note that for permits purchased via Payroll\n Deduction, we deduct from your paycheck the month after the service use so you may not\n qualify for a\u00a0refund.\nTo upgrade your permit, you will have the option to pay the price difference between\n the permit you previously purchased and the upgraded permit that you want to buy as a\n one-time payment via credit/debit card. Please note that for permits purchased via\n Payroll Deduction, after the enrollment period for payroll deduction closes, we are only\n able to cancel future deductions, and cannot modify current deduction\u00a0amounts.\nTo downgrade your permit, you will be refunded the difference between current value\n of the permit you previously owned and the downgraded permit that you want to buy.\n Please note that for permits purchased via Payroll Deduction, after the enrollment\n period for payroll deduction closes, we are only able to cancel future deductions,\n and cannot modify current deduction\u00a0amounts.\nDowngrades need to be calculated to determine the value used, minus the amount paid,\n then apply any overpayment to the current permit price, which is then paid out of pocket.\n This means your permit would then be paid in full with no future deductions, which leads\n to a lower payment\u00a0overall.\nYou can cancel, upgrade, downgrade, or exchange your permit by contacting park@utdallas.edu\n and requesting a permit return\u00a0form.\n\nParking Enforcement\nParking regulations are continuously enforced for:\n\nFire lanes.\nLoading docks.\nService Vehicle spaces.\nGrass and all other areas where parking is prohibited.\nReserved parking spaces.\nPurple parking.\nOrange parking.\nEvening Orange parking.\nGold parking.\nAccessible parking.\nPay-by-Space metered parking.\n\nParking regulations are enforced Monday-Thursday 9:00\u00a0a.m. - 9:00\u00a0p.m.,\n and Friday from 9:00\u00a0a.m. - 5:00\u00a0p.m., for:\n\nGreen parking.\nUniversity Village Apartments parking.\nCanyon Creek Heights Apartments parking.\nUniversity Commons Residence Halls parking.\n\nViolating parking regulations will result in a citation.\nNo overnight campus parking is allowed without prior authorization from both \nParking & Transportation and the University Police\u00a0Department.\nAccessible Parking Permit\nTo use one of the Accessible parking spaces on campus,\n you must already own a State of Texas accessible parking license plate/placard, and\n you must purchase a UT Dallas accessible parking permit. When purchasing your\u00a0permit:\n\nIf you use a accessible parking placard, please present either the original, a photocopy,\n     or picture of your placard in person or via email. You may also send it via email\n     to park@utdallas.edu\n     for\u00a0validation.\nIf you use an accessible parking license plate or a Disabled Veterans plate, please submit\n     documentation either in person or via email to park@utdallas.edu\n     for validation. Documentation can be the tax receipt for your plate,\n     or any certified document in you name with your plate number\u00a0listed.\n\nOnce your accessible parking credentials are validated, you will be able to see the\n accessible parking permit option available for purchase online.\nAccessible Parking Spaces (PDF [Portable Document Format File] )\nIf accessible parking spaces are not available, anyone with a Disabled Veterans plate or a\n state-issued accessible parking placard or plate, and displaying a UTD permit (either a\n accessible parking permit or visitor pass), may park in any available non-reserved parking\n space or metered parking space at no additional\u00a0cost.\nDecorated Veteran Parking\nIf your vehicle has been issued a Disabled Veteran\n (DV [Disabled Veteran] )\n license plate, by state law you are exempt from paying a parking fee. Please note you\n must have these specialty plates to qualify for this exemption. Although you may be exempt\n from paying for a permit, a parking permit is still required from our office for you to\n legally park on campus. A complimentary parking permit will be issued to you after you\n register your vehicle and contact the Parking Office. Please note, this exemption only applies\n when you are driving the vehicle and is not transferrable to\u00a0others.\nPay-By-Space\n\u00a0\n\nThere are over 300 Pay-by-Space cash-less metered parking\n spaces on campus. To use one of these spaces, remember your parking space number or stall number\n and go up to the nearest payment kiosk (\u201cLUKE Machine\u201d), tap any key to wake it up,\n then follow its instructions. You have three ways to pay:\n\nSwipe your credit card or debit card through the kiosk.\nEnter a Department Coupon Code.\nIf you already have an account with the PayByPhone service, you can pay through their web site;\n     through their Android\u2122, BlackBerry\u2122, or iPhone\u00ae app; or by calling 888.450.7275. Their normal services fees will apply.\n\nCurrent Rates: $2 for the first hour, plus $1 for each additional\u00a0hour.\nPlease remember to keep your receipt; It shows the time when your meter expires.\n If your time has not yet expired, and you paid via credit/debit card or Department Coupon Code, you can return to the kiosk\n and add more time. If you used PayByPhone, you can add more time remotely, and even set up\n the service to send you an SMS [Short Message Service] \n five minutes before your time\u00a0expires.\nDepartment Coupon Code\nPlease contact us if your department would like us to create a coupon code\n that you can hand out to your guests for use at Pay-By-Space metered parking spaces.

Charges go directly to your cost\u00a0center.\n\nVisitor Pass\nVisitors to campus include any person who is not affiliated with the\n University as a student, faculty, or staff member. Currently enrolled students, or\n currently employed faculty or staff, do not qualify for visitor\u00a0permits.\nVisitor parking can be issued to those visiting UTD for legitimate business or academic\n purposes if requested by the sponsoring department. Departments may use our online permit request tool or visit one of our\n offices during our normal business hours to obtain a permit for a University approved\n guest. Please reach out to the department you are visiting to have them arrange parking\n for\u00a0you.\nIf you are a faculty or staff member and you need to arrange parking for a guest visiting\n the campus, permits can also be requested online in advance and emailed to you as a \nPDF [Portable Document Format File] \n document that you may email to your guest to be printed.

Non-electric\n vehicles are subject to immediate vehicle immobilization or\u00a0towing.\nTo utilize electric vehicle parking, your vehicle must be charging. There is no cost\n to charge your vehicle, but you must abide by parking rules and regulations by either\n paying the LUKE parking meter, if in a metered space, or utilizing a \nGold\n or higher-level parking permit. Visitor permits are also eligible in electric vehicle spaces\n in lieu of a \nGold or higher\u00a0permit.\nTo ensure that all electric vehicle owners have the opportunity to utilize this service,\n there is a 4-hour maximum time limit for charging and parking in reserved electric\n vehicle\u00a0spaces.\nCitations\nYou can pay citations online, or in-person at the Parking Office. The Parking Office accepts credit cards\n but not cash or checks at this\u00a0time.\nPlease note that if you pay for a citation on a vehicle, that vehicle will then be\n registered to you and you may be responsible for future citations on that\u00a0vehicle.\nIf you receive a citation, you will have 14 days to pay it. On the 14th day,\n a $10 penalty will be added, and another $10 penalty will be added every month\n until it is paid, adding up to $40 in late fees per citation. Students with unpaid\n citations will not be able to register for classes and their transcripts will not be\n released. Faculty and staff with unpaid citations will have their records marked and\n their parking permit revoked; any renumerations owed them when they separate from the\n University will be\u00a0blocked.\nVehicles may receive a parking citation each calendar day, even if the vehicle has not moved since the previous day. Additionally, vehicles may be cited more than once, even in the same day, if they are committing multiple violations, or if the vehicle moves\u00a0locations.\nReceiving parking citations will result in a negative account hold, which prevents students from receiving certain services. Parking citations will place a B35 \u201cParking Fine\u201d hold on student accounts. A B35 hold will not prevent students from registering for classes, but it will prevent the ability to receive a\u00a0transcript.\nIf a student owes more than $500 to the University and their balance is more than 45 days past due, a B98 \u201cPast Due Balance\u201d hold will apply. A B98 hold will prevent class registration, loan activity, and refund\u00a0distributions.\nTo release a parking hold, you must pay your parking balance via the MyParking portal. Once citations have been paid, the hold will be released the following business day. \nTo check student account hold information, log in to the Galaxy portal, select Orion Self-Service,\n then select Student\u00a0Center.\nAppealing Citations\nIf you feel you have received a citation in error, you may file an appeal using\n the following\u00a0guidelines:\n\nAppeals can be accepted only through the online appeal portal through MyParking.\n     Please have your citation or license plate\u00a0available.\nAppeals must be filed before the 14th calendar day from the date\n     of citation issuance. On the 14th day, your ability to appeal\n     is\u00a0forfeited.\nLate fees will not accumulate while a citation is under\u00a0appeal.\nIf your appeal is rejected, you must pay your citation promptly. Late fees\n     will begin accumulating monthly after an appeal is\u00a0denied.\nAn appeal cannot be filed for a citation that has already been paid.\n     Once a citation has been paid, the ability to appeal is forfeited.\nA vehicle may continue to be cited, even while under the appeal process\n     if the vehicle is still found in violation. A vehicle must park in compliance\n     to avoid additional citations.
